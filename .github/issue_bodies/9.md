Summary:

Header renders a disabled "Chains" link pointing to `/chains` when active, but the real route is `/platforms`. While disabled via CSS, the URL is incorrect and inconsistent.

Expected:

Use `/platforms` consistently and consider renaming to "Platforms".

Proposed fix:

- Always set the button `href` to `/platforms` regardless of active state.
- Rename the button text to "Platforms" for clarity.
