Summary:

The coin details table includes rows for CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, but the v2 backend no longer fetches those sources. The rows render empty values, which is confusing.

Impact:

Users see empty/unused source rows implying multi-source validation that no longer exists.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open `/coins/:symbol`.
2. Inspect the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko rows; most cells are empty.

Expected:

Hide or remove CMC and CoinGecko rows when no data is present.

Proposed fix:

- Conditionally render CMC/CoinGecko rows only when data exists.
- Optionally add a note that Messari is the single data source for v2.
- If multi-source validation is desired, track as a separate enhancement.
