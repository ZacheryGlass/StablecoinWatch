Summary:

`coins.ejs` uses `<%- coin.msri.desc %>` which injects raw HTML. If Messari descriptions include HTML or unsafe content, this can cause XSS.

Expected:

Descriptions should be sanitized or escaped before rendering.

Proposed fix:

- Sanitize/strip HTML server-side before rendering, or switch to escaped output (`<%= ... %>`) after cleaning.
- Consider a whitelist if limited rich text is desired.
