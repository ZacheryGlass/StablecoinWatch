Summary:

The SDK does not expose Stablecoins endpoints; the backend calls `client.request({ method: 'GET', path: '/metrics/v2/stablecoins' })` directly. This relies on an internal method and may break on SDK updates.

Impact:

Potential runtime failure on SDK upgrades if request signature or baseUrl handling changes.

Expected:

Use a stable, documented SDK method or isolate the internal call.

Proposed fix:

- Wrap the call in a small, isolated helper with basic test coverage.
- Track the SDK roadmap and switch to an official method when exposed.
- Alternatively, perform a direct `fetch` for the Stablecoins endpoints with explicit headers, keeping the rest of the integration on the SDK.
