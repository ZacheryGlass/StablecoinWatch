Summary:

Header shows "Total $ on ETH" and "Total % on ETH" using placeholders (0), a v1 artifact.

Impact:

Confusing UX; always displays `$0` and `0.0%`.

Expected:

Either compute real ETH share or remove these metrics.

Proposed fix:

- Compute ETH total from `platform_data` (sum where `name === 'Ethereum'`) and pass to templates, or remove until implemented.
- Align naming with "Platforms" (not "Chains").
