Summary:

Coin and platform views rely on per-chain data (`platform.circulating_supply`/`circulating_supply_s`) and `platform.contract_url`, but the v2 Messari integration does not provide these fields. Templates show `?` or `No data`, and the explorer link `href` is undefined.

Impact:

- Platform distribution table on coin pages lacks values.
- "Explore Contract" link renders with an undefined `href`.
- Platform detail pages show "No data" for key columns.

Steps to reproduce:

1. View a coin page at `/coins/:symbol`.
2. Inspect the Platforms section: supply cells show `?` and link icons point to `undefined`.
3. View a platform page at `/platforms/:name`; columns show "No data".

Expected:

Either real per-chain supply and contract links, or the UI hides those columns when not available.

Proposed fix:

- Use Messari Stablecoins metrics per-network breakdown (network metricGroup) to derive latest per-network circulating supply; map to platform names.
- Hide "Explore Contract" and per-platform supply/percentage columns when data is unavailable.
- If a vetted contract mapping exists, ingest and use it for links (document provenance).
