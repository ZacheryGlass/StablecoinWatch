Summary:

`views/coins.ejs` uses `coin.img_url` directly; when absent, the image breaks. `home.ejs` has a fallback to `/default-logo.png`.

Expected:

Coin pages should fall back to a default logo when no image is provided.

Proposed fix:

- Add the same default image fallback logic to `coins.ejs` used in `home.ejs`.
