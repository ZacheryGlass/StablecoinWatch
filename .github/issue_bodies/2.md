Summary:

Chains page (`/platforms`) renders links to `/platforms/<p.uri>` but `DataService.calculatePlatformData` does not supply a `uri`; links resolve to `/platforms/undefined`.

Impact:

Users cannot navigate to platform details from the platforms list.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start the app with a valid `MESSARI_API_KEY`.
2. Visit `/platforms`.
3. Inspect any platform link: `href` is `/platforms/undefined` and navigation fails.

Expected:

Each platform entry includes a stable `uri` (lowercase, hyphenated) so links navigate to `/platforms/{platform-slug}`.

Proposed fix:

- Include a `uri` field when building `platform_data` (e.g., `name.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')`).
- Ensure routes normalize underscores/hyphens consistently when reading `req.params.name`.
