Summary:

The pie chart on coin pages relies on per-platform `circulating_supply` and total coin `circulating_supply`. With the Messari-only integration, these values are often undefined, resulting in an empty or broken chart.

Impact:

Misleading or non-functional visualization on coin pages.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open `/coins/:symbol`.
2. Observe the Platforms pie chart; it renders blank or with invalid values.

Expected:

If per-network distribution is unavailable, the chart should be hidden or show a clear "No data" state.

Proposed fix:

- Derive per-network supply from Messari Stablecoins timeseries (network breakdown) for the latest date; fall back to hiding the chart when not available.
- Gracefully skip undefined values in the dataset to avoid rendering errors.
