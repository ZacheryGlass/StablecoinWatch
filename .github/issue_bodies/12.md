Summary:

The repo contains v1 artifacts that are no longer used in v2:

- `interface/datasource/messari.js` (uses deprecated `messari-api` package)
- Various helpers in `app/util.js` likely unused (e.g., `getTokenPlatform`, `sortObjByNumProperty`)

Impact:

Confuses contributors and bloats the codebase.

Proposed fix:

- Delete `interface/datasource` directory.
- Audit `app/util.js`, remove unused exports, or document what's still needed.
- Drop any stale dependencies tied to v1.
