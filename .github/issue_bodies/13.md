Summary:

A long technical write-up exists at `SCWv2.txt` in the repo root. It should either live under `docs/` with a proper name or be removed if obsolete.

Proposed fix:

- Convert to Markdown and move under `docs/` (e.g., `docs/SCWv2_guide.md`) or delete if superseded by README and Messari reference.
