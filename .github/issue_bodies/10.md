Summary:

In `views/donate.ejs`, ETH/BCH/XMR QR image `src` attributes use relative paths (e.g., `ethqr.png`), which resolve to `/donate/ethqr.png` and 404.

Expected:

Static images should resolve under the static root.

Proposed fix:

- Prefix with `/` for static root (e.g., `/ethqr.png`, `/bchqr.png`, `/xmrqr.png`).
- Verify Express static mounts are correct.
