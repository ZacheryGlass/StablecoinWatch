            "background_details": "\nPre-history\nBitcoin borrows from nearly three decades of research by academics, cypherpunk practitioners, and hobbyists who tried to create similar payment protocols. Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, e-gold, and Bit Gold. Bitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the political affiliations of early Bitcoin investors. \n\nConception to Launch\nOn October 31, 2008, at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis, just six weeks after the infamous investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, the pseudonymous <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/satoshi-nakamoto\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> released the Bitcoin whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list. Titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\", the whitepaper proposed a new electronic cash system that would allow fully peer-to-peer online payments without reliance on trusted third parties. Soon after the release of the whitepaper, Satoshi implemented the Bitcoin software as open-source code. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi mining the genesis block of Bitcoin, which included a now-famous \"The Times\" headline in the <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/coinbase-transaction\">coinbase</a> both to prove the network’s fair launch and to make a political statement about the global financial system. The event marked the birth of the world's first non-sovereign, decentralized, digital money.\n\nPost Launch\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/hal-finney\">Hal Finney</a>, who invented the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004, received the first Bitcoin transaction (10 bitcoins) on January 12, 2009. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/laszlo-hanyecz\">Laszlo Hanyecz</a> bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. \n\nIn August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted and exploited in the Bitcoin network, allowing users to create an infinite amount of bitcoins. The transactions exploiting the vulnerability were quickly spotted and erased for the Bitcoin blockchain, with the vulnerability being patched in a network upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.\n\nIn December 2010, amidst rising publicity from Bitcoin's use in financing Wikileaks, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from involvement with Bitcoin. It is unknown why Satoshi disappeared from the project, although some believe Satoshi, cognizant of past struggles to launch a digital currency, recognized that a leader of the Bitcoin project could be a central point of failure. It is estimated that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/gavin-andresen\">Gavin Andresen</a>.\n\nSilk Road & Mt. Gox\nOne of the most iconic early use cases for Bitcoin was the Silk Road. Launched in early 2011, the Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide variety of goods including, most notably, illegal drugs. Underpinning the Silk Road was the Tor network, which allowed users to browse the Silk Road anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring, and Bitcoin which provided a censorship-resistant payment rail for pseudonymous transactions. Over the course of its life, it is estimated that the Silk Road facilitated more than $1.2 billion in transactions, collecting over $80 million in sales commissions, leveraging the Bitcoin network as its payment rail. The site was shut down in 2013 when the FBI took advantage of the Silk Road’s centralized infrastructure, arresting founder <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/ross-ulbricht\">Ross Ulbricht</a>, and shuttering the site.\n\nFounded by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\">Jed McCaleb</a> in July 2010, and led by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/mark-karpeles\">Mark Karpeles</a> until it collapsed, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/mtgox\">Mt. Gox</a> was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges in the world. Based in Tokyo, Japan, the exchange would go on to handle over 70% of all bitcoin (BTC) transactions worldwide at its peak. Known for its chronic security issues, Mt. Gox was infamously hacked in 2014, losing 850,000 bitcoins worth about $450 million at the time. The hack sent the price of Bitcoin, which was in the midst of one of its first major price bubbles, plummeting. Bitcoin would sink into a bear market with prices not recovering until the 2017 bull run.\n\n2017 Bubble & Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork\nThe 2017 price bubble was a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1900% from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year to near $20,000 at its peak in December. At its peak, Bitcoin's market capitalization eclipsed $325 billion. Along with the proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings, powered by Ethereum, Bitcoin's incredible 2017 run propelled cryptocurrency into mainstream consciousness, among the most discussed phenomena of 2017.\n\nAlso notable in 2017, Bitcoin experienced its <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\">most contentious fork to date</a>. Amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly divergent views on scaling Bitcoin, an agreement was reached amongst prominent Bitcoin stakeholders in what is now known as the \"New York Agreement\". The agreement was to support a set of network upgrades called SegWit2x. The proposal was backed by over 80% of Bitcoin's hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> without the 2MB block size increase, the philosophy underpinning this decision being that the users controlled the network, not miners and Bitcoin businesses. Subsequently, they set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017, they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. These events marked, one end, a landmark demonstration of power by the users of the Bitcoin network, and on the other end, the first great schism within the Bitcoin community.\n\n2018 - 2019\nAfter peaking in December 2017, Bitcoin, along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market in January 2018, crashed, sending the cryptocurrency market into its latest bear market. Since then Bitcoin has dropped as low as $3,200, more than 80% below its ATH. However, while prices have yet to recover to 2017 highs, the institutionalization of Bitcoin has picked up significantly. Traditional Wall Street institutions including Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, and Fidelity have all launched cryptocurrency offerings, opening up the market to institutional investors. There are now several regulated exchanges and custodians. Furthermore, regulatory clarity around Bitcoin has improved dramatically with SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, revealing at a Congressional hearing in February 2018, that the SEC does not consider Bitcoin to be a security.\n\nSince it reached its cycle low in February 2019, Bitcoin's price has recovered considerably, rising as high as $13,000 in June. With the recent announcements of Facebook's Libra project and China's Central Bank digital currency, governments and multinational corporations around the world have begun to look at cryptocurrencies more seriously. American officials are debating a digital dollar and lawmakers around the world are considering the central bank digital currency (CBDC) options. Furthermore, there have been numerous cryptocurrency-related hearings since Libra was announced. China has recently <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/china-blockchain-madness\">announced</a> blockchain was a revolutionary technology and that it would make blockchain technology a strategic imperative for the country. Bitcoin's price rose more than 40% after the announcement, its highest intraday movement since 2011.\n\n2020 - 2021\nBitcoin traded sideways into 2020, but the onset of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic saw world markets take the biggest dips since at least the 2007-08 Mortgage Crisis. Bitcoin did not escape the dip – in less than 48 hours it lost half of its value, going below $4,000 for the first time since March of 2019. Luckily for bitcoiners, bitcoin rebounded, returning to its pre-pandemic price in less than a month.\n\nBitcoin’s ascent recovery out of the March turmoil drew wider media and institutional attention and lent credibility to its store of value narrative. Although it remained around $10,000 throughout Ethereum’s firey <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/a-data-driven-look-at-the-end-of-defi-s-summer\">DeFi summer</a>, bitcoin would start to trend upwards into the fall and by early November bitcoin hit $14,000. Whether it was unprecedented levels of money printing by the Federal Reserve, its V-shaped recovery in April, or direct stimulus payments to millions of Americans, it was clear bitcoin wasn’t done at $14,000 as it crossed $20,000 for the first time ever on December 16, 2020. Two weeks later it hit $28,000. Then, on January 8, 2021, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $41,429.38. Since hitting $41,000 bitcoin has mostly drifted in the $30,000.\n\nBitcoin’s price wasn’t the only thing rapidly accelerating in 2020. Institutional adoption skyrocketed. Led by Michael Saylor of Microstrategy (  $1 billion), institutions joined the bitcoin world en masse. From insurance companies like MassMutual ($100 million) to investment firms like Ruffer ($744 million) new groups <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-potential-impact-of-increased-capital-allocation-to-bitcoin\">continue</a> to adopt bitcoin. And institutions aren’t alone – entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and politicians like Miami Mayor Francis Suarez have increasingly promoted bitcoin. Even athletes have joined the space, as NFL player Russell Okung partnered with Bitcoin Lightning Company <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/zap\">Zap</a> to become the first professional sports player ever to be paid in bitcoin\n\n",

Since blocks are generated every 10 minutes on average and starting at 50 new bitcoins per block when the system was launched in 2009, this creates a very well-defined supply curve. \n\nThe stability of Bitcoin's monetary policy\nBitcoin's monetary policy is disinflationary. The annual rate of inflation decreases through time. The current supply cap of Bitcoin is set at 21 million coins. The stability of Bitcoin's monetary policy provided by this well-defined supply cap and halving schedule is a key differentiator versus other crypto assets. \n\nLearn More:\nA Model for Bitcoin's Security and the Declining Block Subsidy",

A network of mining and economic <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\">nodes</a> maintains this ledger by validating, propagating, and fighting to include <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/mempool\">mempool</a> transactions in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work.\n\nMining difficulty regularly adjusts to maintain Bitcoin's average ten-minute block schedule. Mining nodes add new blocks to whatever chain has the largest accumulated proof of work maintained by a network of economic nodes with downloaded copies of the same chain.\n\nLearn More:\nBitcoin Developer's Guide\nMastering Bitcoin",

They decided to disclose the DDoS vulnerability immediately while keeping the inflation bug quiet. This provided developers time to reach out to miners, businesses, and other affected systems about upgrading their software, while also providing additional time to fix the exploit.\n\nhttps://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/18/release-0.16.3/\nhttps://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/"

        "governance": {
          "governance_details": "Model Overview\nBitcoin governance is the process by which protocol rules are decided upon, implemented, and enforced. Users (full nodes) adopt new rules according to their subjective views on what Bitcoin is and should be. If two or more individuals adopt the same set of rules, they form an inter-subjective social consensus of what “Bitcoin” is. It is in this respect that many conceptualize Bitcoin as being set by a social contract. Every time rule changes are contemplated, the rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously between stakeholders. Protocol changes are legitimized when users agree to adopt the new changes. Once adopted, the Bitcoin protocol automates the enforcement of the social contract.\n\nProcess Overview\nProtocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin community can submit <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip\">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals</a> (\"BIPs\"). After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Bitcoin Core maintainers merge code changes into Bitcoin Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Bitcoin Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nOnce rules are adopted on-chain, all new transactions and block proposals are subject to the agreed-upon rules. Full nodes only accept new transactions and block proposals that are valid according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Anything that is not valid will be rejected. Thus, miners must implement the prevailing rules of the network in order to participate in the block creation process. \n\nUser Activated Hard Fork\n2017's <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\">User Activated Soft Fork Event</a> provided an illustrative case study on Bitcoin governance in practice. \n\nAs early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around block size began. These discussions largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. In May 2017, a meeting between miners, businesses, investors, and core developers took place at the Consensus conference in New York, in what is now referred to as the \"New York Agreement\". The product of this meeting was an agreement to support <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> (a soft fork) and a 2MB block size (hard fork). \n\nKnown as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. This plan was proposed as BIP 148, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, from a pseudonymous developer named <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/shaolin-fry\">Shaolinfry</a>. Soon after, users set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Eventually, enough nodes signaled support for it, forcing miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. \n\nMany see this user-activated soft fork (UASF) as a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. The philosophy underpinning the event was that users controlled the network, not miners. The event not only illustrated the balance of power within Bitcoin's network, but also calmed suspicions that parties such as miners, businesses, or Bitcoin Core developers, controlled Bitcoin. \n\nLearn More: \nBitcoin Governance\nUnpacking Bitcoin's Social Contract\nWho Controls Bitcoin Core?\nBitcoin Miners Beware: Invalid Blocks Need Not Apply",

Buterin published the first Ethereum white paper later that year, describing a distributed computing platform for executing smart contracts and building <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>. In 2014, Buterin and some other early contributors founded the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\">Ethereum Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum’s research, core protocol development, and ecosystem growth. The foundation's first task was to host the Ethereum crowdsale, which raised 31,529 <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">BTC</a> (~$18 million at the time) in exchange for about 60 million ether, and use the proceeds to fund the network's initial development. The Ethereum Foundation continues to be the primary funding organization, issuing grants to research teams and projects focused on Ethereum.\n\nThe rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs)\nEthereum's mainnet launched in July 2015, with the first live release known as Frontier. Shortly thereafter, Augur (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/augur\">REP</a>) conducted the first <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/initial-coin-offering-ico\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>, in which the startup sold its Ethereum-based REP tokens (created via the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\">ERC-20</a> standard) to help fund the project. The ability to develop and sell a newly generated token to help raise capital became an attractive method of fundraising because projects could circumvent the legal policies and costs required from traditional companies (until more recently). Ethereum-focused startups created thousands of new tokens since Augur's ICO, raising billions of dollars in the process.\n\nThe DAO hack\nIn April 2016, a decentralized venture fund known as <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-dao\">The DAO</a> hosted an ICO, raising ~$150 million in ETH in the process. A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the guilty party to siphon 3.6 million ETH. A significant portion of the Ethereum community opted to revert the chain to remove The DAO and its subsequent hack from the network's history. The remaining stakeholders held the preservation of immutability in higher regard and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide in the community led to a contentious hard fork a few weeks post-hack, causing a permanent split in the network. The legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history is now known as Ethereum Classic (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\">$ETC</a>).\n\nThe path to scalability: Ethereum 2.0\nScalability is a known limitation for the current state of Ethereum. Periods of high user activity, as seen during the CryptoKitties launch in Nov. 2017 and the DeFi bonanza during the Summer of 2020, can cause transaction times and fees to skyrocket, which often prices out retail users and newcomers.\n\nThe potential shortcomings of Ethereum's current design are nothing new to Ethereum developers. Various teams have been working since the launch of Ethereum to upgrade the network to account for better scalability and security measures without compromising the community's values of decentralization. The current plan is to swap Ethereum's consensus layer from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and implement a scaling technique known as sharding in a massive upgrade called Serenity (also referred to as Ethereum 2.0).\n\nEthereum developers have broken down this upgrade into three or more phases to minimize complexity as they add more features. The first phase Phase 0 has a minimum launch date of Dec. 1, 2020. It will bring the Beacon Chain (the backbone of Ethereum 2.0) to life and enable the network to bootstrap a stable of validators to ensure network security. The following phases are being developed in parallel but might take several years before they reach completion.",

The core developers concluded, \"there's no major reason do it now\" because the difficulty bomb is only necessary once Ethereum 2.0 and its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism are activated. Overlooking an Ice Age EIP for now also prevents any further delays in Berlin's development phase.\n\nCore devs and the greater Ethereum community also excludes the EIP-1057, the proposal for the now-infamous ProgPoW (short for Progressive Proof-of-Work). It aimed to alter Ethereum's hashing algorithm to close the performance efficiency gap between generalized and specialized mining hardware (otherwise known as ASICs). While GPU miners and some core devs favored the proposal, many in the community were vehemently against it. Therefore, all sides agree to a href=\"https://messari.io/article/progpow-wars-ethereum-dev-call-places-a-spotlight-on-the-progpow-debate\"not include ProgPoW/a in any upcoming forks as no protocol changes are worth triggering a network split\n\nLearn more:\nBerlin EIPs spreadsheet"

Those block rewards incentivize miners to secure the network. Miners that find an uncle block also receive 87.5% of the base block reward. Uncle blocks occur when several distinct miners simultaneously mine a block. In this case, the block that has the most accumulated PoW is conserved, and others are rejected. Unlike the Bitcoin chain that does not reward miners for orphan blocks, the Ethereum chain does reward uncle block miners. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncle block miners. As <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> notes, the initial intent behind rewarding uncle block miners was to avoid mining centralization caused by the network lag that smaller miners could endure:\n  \"This mechanic was originally introduced to reduce centralization pressures, by reducing the advantage that well-connected miners have over poorly connected miners.\"\n\nIn 2017, the difficulty bomb increased block times drastically, thus reducing the issuance rate. Indeed, the difficulty bomb, also known as \"ice age\" was initially designed as a mechanism to disincentivize miners to continue mining the Ethereum chain by making it exponentially harder to create a new block. This was meant to accelerate the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe Casper development and transition to Proof-of-Stake being delayed, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/afri-schoedon\">Afri Schoeden</a> proposed to delay the difficulty bomb and reduce the block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether, thus leaving the system in the same general state as before. This proposal, EIP 649, was included in the Byzantium hard fork which was implemented on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, thus effectively reducing block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether and delaying the difficulty bomb for approximately 1.4 years.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, the Constantinople hard fork further reduced block rewards from 3 Ether to 2 Ether, and once again delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months with EIP 1234.\n\nThe Ethereum's Parity multi-sig wallet bug\n\nOn November 06, 2017, a vulnerability in the \"library\" smart contract code was exploited by an anonymous user. Subsequently, the user destroyed the library contract. This destruction locked forever a total amount of 513,774.16 Ether located in 587 multi-signatures parity wallets. <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-proprietary-methods\">Messari Proprietary Methodology</a> to calculate liquid supply excludes any non-transferable coins. Thus, these locked Ether are considered illiquid and are not included in our liquid supply calculation.\n\nETH 2.0 and the transition to Casper Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn ETH 2.0, the Ethereum chain will be maintained via a new proof-of-stake system, where rewards will be distributed on a sliding scale based on the total amount staked on the network. The more total supply that’s staked, the higher the system-wide issuance rate (to incentivize high cumulative participation). Although individual yields will decline as the staking participation increases. A table posted by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> on Github lays out the sliding scale issuance rate. \n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/justin-drake\">Justin Drake</a>, a researcher at the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\">Ethereum Foundation</a>, argued that targeting 30,000,000 ETH at stake, long-term, “seems about right for strong security.” It would represent about 30% of the network and result in an approximate 3% annual inflation. Nevertheless, the penalties applied to validators going offline as well as the slashing penalties and the transaction fees burnt due to EIP 1559 will lead to the destruction of Ether, thus reducing the total net issuance amount.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake will occur in three or four stages, according to the latest specifications shared by the core developers:\nPhase 0, expected for Dec. 1, 2020, will initially increase issuance compared to the current level. This is due to the fact that both the Proof-of-Work and Beacon Chain will run simultaneously and rewards will be distributed on both chains, although the staking participation, and thus annual issuance on the Beacon Chain, will most likely be very low during this Phase.\nPhase 1, expected for Q4 2021, will allow finalizing the Proof-of-Work chain with Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Work rewards will most likely be reduced to match an issuance rate between 0.5% and 1% (versus 4.5% before Phase 1). Both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake rewards will co-exist and the global issuance rate should be around 1% at that stage.\nPhase 1.5, estimated for 2022, will mark when Ethereum 2.0 transfers will likely unlock, giving stakers access to their previously inaccessible staked ETH and accumulated rewards. These rewards and staking amounts will date back to the launch of the Beacon Chain.\nPhase 2, estimated for 2023, will progressively lead to an increase of staking participation, thus increasing the annual issuance rate, while Proof-of-Work will simultaneously progressively disappear.\n\n",

              "consensus_details": "Modified GHOST protocol\nThe Ethereum White Paper states Ethereum uses a modified version of the \"Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree\" (GHOST) protocol to distinguish the \"longest\" base chain (the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work backing it) from forks. <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\">Nakamoto Consensus</a>, the implementation used by Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">$BTC</a>) and its forks, is problematic in networks with fast confirmation times (i.e., block times) like Ethereum. Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single mining pool could obtain a majority of the hashpower on a given chain.\n\nThe GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including orphan blocks in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain by weighing the parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.\n\nSome say GHOST works better in theory than in practice, claiming Ethereum further modified its consensus implementation before (or soon after) launch to avoid security complications. Others suggest the Ethereum consensus model better resembles Nakamoto consensus or a modified version of the Inclusive protocol. But the inclusion of EIP-100 in the Byzantium fork changed Ethereum's difficulty calculation algorithm to include orphan blocks, which indicates the proposed modified GHOST implementation is intact. Regardless of the security model classification, Ethereum continues to reward orphan block miners with 87.5% of the base block reward.\n\nMining\nEthereum miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash, using the Keccak-256 and Keccak-512 hash functions, as defined by Ethereum's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin's biweekly adjustments, Ethereum recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.\n\nCryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. The majority of the Ethereum remains opposed to ASIC miners, as evidenced by its support for the ProgPoW EIP (a likely inclusion in the second Istanbul hard fork). Ethereum also plans to transition to a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> consensus model, which would render any mining equipment obsolete.",

          "overview": {
            "technology_details": "Account-based model\nEthereum is an account-based blockchain consisting of external accounts, which are controlled by a user’s private keys, and contract accounts, which are managed by contract code. External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contracts</a> and enable the programmability of <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine\nThe heart of the Ethereum blockchain is known as the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine\">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>, which is the part of the protocol that executes transactions. It is a Turing complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum node operators and miners provide these scarce resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas. Different operations require different amounts of gas, and the user can specify how much they are willing to pay in ETH for each unit of gas. The amount of gas required for the transaction, along with the price paid, becomes the transaction cost. Every transaction also had a gas limit to prevent attacks from overloading blocks, which could slow down block production.\n\nDeveloper tools and token standards\nEthereum adopted <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\">Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20</a> in late 2015 as a standard for Ethereum smart contracts to issue tokens on the platform. The majority of tokens built on Ethereum are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they follow a standard set of rules defining how they are created and used. Another more popular token rule set is ERC-721 with standardizes the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) where any given token is distinguishable from another making them popular for gaming.\n\nEthereum 2.0\nAs Ethereum transitions to Eth 2.0, it will undergo significant changes to its design. It will transition from <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work</a> to <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\">Proof-of-Stake</a> and feature a sharding architecture. Currently, nodes must validate every transaction to maintain an updated global state. The new sharding model segments the network into various groups (called shards) and randomly assigns nodes to each shard. Rather than having to monitor the entire chain, nodes only have to validate their respective shard(s). Individual shards shared their transaction details with the Beacon Chain, which acts as the backbone of Ethereum 2.0. The Beacon Chain serves to validate the transactions on each shard, helping the entire network reach consensus. It also identifies dishonest validators and initiates penalties in the form of slashing, in which a portion of a validator's stake is removed from circulation. Eth 2.0 will also replace the EVM with Ethereum WebAssembly (eWASM), which intends to translate coding logic more efficiently and help improve Ethereum’s scalability.",

The attack reduced the rate of block production by 50-66% as block validation times ballooned to 20-60 seconds (as opposed to 12-14 seconds).\n\nIn response, Ethereum developers opted to initiate a hard fork at block 2463000 (Oct. 18, 2016) to implement EIP-150, which addressed the issue of underpriced operation codes to make future DDoS attacks cost-prohibitive. The Ethereum team initially proposed issuing a second hard fork upgrade to introduce EIP-158. But they later decided to replace it with EIP-161, which they included in the Spurious Dragon hard fork."

Ripple enables banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges, and corporations to send money globally using blockchain technology. Leveraging the prior work of <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/ryan-fugger\">Ryan Fugger</a>, in 2012 Ripple created the XRP Ledger (formerly known as Ripple Consensus Ledger), an open-source cryptographic ledger powered by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. XRP is the native asset of the XRP ledger.\n\nIn 2004, Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a financial technology company aiming to create a peer-to-peer payments network. Separately, in 2011, a team of Jed McCaleb began the development of a new consensus network for digital currencies that would ultimately become the XRP Ledger. Later Chris Larsen, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-schwartz\">David Schwartz</a>, and Arthur Britto, would join the project, and in 2012 McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan about RipplePay. After discussion with the RipplePay community Ryan handed over the project to McCaleb and Larsen, and in September 2012 they founded Opencoin (re-branded to Ripple Labs in 2013). \n\nIn 2013 Ripple released XRP, a native token on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. At launch, it created 100 billion XRP tokens of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. Over the course of 2013, Ripple would raise over $7.5 million from some of the most prestigious venture firms in the united states. Later that year Jed McCaleb would leave the company over internal disputes around the company's vision and would ultimately go on to found Stellar.\n\nAfter the initial release of the XRP Ledger, Ripple focused its efforts on getting financial institutions to use the ledger to process remittances. Entering the cross border payments market led to regulatory scrutiny, with FinCEN fining Ripple Inc for violating the bank secrecy act in 2015. As part of the remedial plan related to the fine, Ripple Inc agreed to enhance the anti-money laundering capabilities of the XRP protocol and stricter permissioning requirements were added for additional participants to join the network.\n\nTo further enhance the credibility of XRP as a partner for traditional financial institutions, Ripple obtained a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitlicense\">BitLicense</a> from the State of New York in 2016. The upside of these enhancements and engagement with regulators was it gave XRP the capability to more deeply integrate with the traditional financial system. \n\nToday XRP's primary use is as a bridge currency underpinning <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\">Ripple</a>'s xRapid product, an on-demand liquidity solution. xRapid allows financial institutions to exchange value between fiat currencies through a network a digital asset exchanges that use XRP as a bridge currency for its liquidity.\n\nTo date Ripple has raised over $120 million in venture funding, and XRP is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Ripple and its founding team own the substantial majority of the XRP supply of which Ripple the company programmatically sells on a quarterly basis. Since 2016 Ripple has sold over $1.1 billion worth of XRP and XRP sales remain Ripple's dominant source of revenue (and controversy).\n\n",

Jed McCaleb donated 2 billion of his allocation to a donor-advised fund. In 2014 McCaleb negotiated an exit agreement from the project dictating his remaining allocation would be held in a custodial account and released to him on a monthly schedule. A daily cap on the amount he can sell of the tokens released is included in the agreement. Today, Ripple’s selling restrictions on co-founder Jed McCaleb allow him to sell his allocation at a theoretical maximum rate of 1% of daily trading volume.\n\n"

Nevertheless, XRP liquid and circulating supply are massively inflationary. \n\nIn December 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow in order to alleviate concerns that a massive amount of XRP could hit the market all at once with substantial negative price impact. 1 billion is being released monthly to support Ripple’s ongoing operation of Ripplenet. Any unused funds are returned to escrow at the end of the month. On average Ripple re-escrows 700 million and 300 million XRP become liquid each month.\n\nRipple generated revenue from ongoing XRP sales, which account for well over 90% of the company's revenue. There are two types of XRP sales that the company discloses:\nProgrammatic sales: These come from the company’s XRP reserve, and can be sold at a rate of no more than 0.25% of average daily volume on defined exchanges. \nDirect sales from XRP II: These come from direct bespoke deals with institutional clients, and include (per Ripple’s 2016-2017 disclosures) reselling restrictions to ensure its partners do not purchase XRP at a discount from the company and then immediately flood the market with sales.\n\nRipple has sold over 1.2 billion USD worth of XRP through Direct Sales and Programmatic Sales. \n\nOur liquid supply curve takes into account the Ripple Escrow mechanism as well as the Founder' selling agreement to calculate liquid supply. As such, even though XRP's outstanding supply is deflationary over time through fee-burning, circulating and liquid supply are massively inflationary due to escrow release, founder's distributions, and Ripple sales. At the current burn rate, it would take 20 years for the XRP Ledger to burn what is distributed by Ripple and its founders every day. \n\nTo date, Messari released to in-depth research on Ripple supply management:\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/xrp-market-cap-may-be-6-1-billion-overstated\">XRP Market Cap may be $6.1 billion overstated</a>\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-research-circulating-supply-study-for-xrp\">Circulating Supply Study for XRP</a>",

This process occurs until a supermajority (80%) of UNL nodes have matching ledgers. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results.

A supermajority of validators is required for the network to arrive at consensus to validate transactions initiated across the network.\n\nRipple Inc, has focused on integrating user verification protocols so network participants are able to define which users they trust and how much they trust them. This has the effect of causing transactions to “ripple” across the network. Because if two users without a direct relationship initiate a transaction across the network. It ripples outward finding a path linking the users together from their trusted relationships to complete the transaction. \n\nFor users just getting started, Ripple Inc. maintains a unique node list users can select by default representing validators with a history of reliably operating on the XRP network.\n\nCross-currency transactions typically take 3 – 5 seconds to process across the ledger. Once initiated, XRP’s pathfinding algorithm identifies the quickest least expensive way to complete the transaction. Generally, for the pathfinding algorithm to work optimally, a large number of market makers need to be operating on the network so sufficient liquidity is available to efficiently complete transactions.\n\nTo encourage the development of a robust ecosystem around the ledger, XRP maintains a variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties interact with it based on the REST API standard. Invoicing and wallet solutions allow businesses to incorporate it as a payment option for their customers.\n",

            "background_details": "Founded in July 2014 by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/brock-pierce\">Brock Pierce</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/craig-sellars\">Craig Sellars</a>, and <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/reeve-collins\">Reeve Collins</a>, Tether (USDT), originally known as \"Realcoin\", is a cryptocurrency commonly known as a “<a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins\">stablecoin</a>” that aims to keep a fixed 1:1 exchange ratio with the U.S. dollar. Tether was one of the earliest stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), which was a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept to the world in 2012. Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model, and is now the most widely used stablecoin today.\n\nTether was created as an attempt to solve two major issues with existing cryptocurrencies: high volatility and convertibility between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To address these perceived issues Tether created a cryptocurrency that is fully backed 1:1 by deposits of U.S. dollars held at banks. On Ethereum, USDT tokens are represented as ERC-20 tokens, while on Bitcoin, Tether utilizes the Omni layer, to represent USDT tokens. While the tokens themselves operate in a decentralized network, Hong Kong based <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/tether-limited\">Tether Ltd</a> is solely responsible for creating and redeeming tokens as well as maintaining the 1:1 deposit backing. \n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDT as an alternative to fiat currencies, reducing or eliminating the need to maintain outside banking relationships. Notable exchanges that utilize the token include <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bittrex\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/binance-holdings-ltd\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/coinbase\">Coinbase</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/kraken\">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/huobi\">Huobi</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/poloniex\">Poloniex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/liquid\">Liquid.io</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/gate-io\">Gate.io</a>, and <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/okex\">OKEx</a>. Tether Ltd shares many executives and has strong ties with Hong Kong based Bitfinex with both sharing the same parent organization <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ifinex-inc\">iFinex Inc</a>.\n\nSince its founding in 2014, Tether has been the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/history-of-tether\">subject of ongoing controversy </a>due to the failure of Tether to provided audited financial statements proving it has adequate reserves backing USDT. Historically Tether has failed to disclose its banking relationships, only recently announcing its banking partners in November 2018 to quell rumors about its solvency raised by associated crypto exchange, Bitfinex.\n\nIn March 2019, Tether updated its disclosure statement claiming that its tokens are no longer backed 100% by U.S. dollar deposits. Tether is instead now backed 100% backed by reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.

Days after the NYAG's action, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel for Bitfinex and Tether, filed an affidavit confirming that Tether was backed by only 74% cash and equivalents with the rest being equity in iFinex.\n\nIn May 2019, Bitfinex and Tether CTO, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/paolo-ardoino\">Paulo Ardoino</a> announced Bitfinex had successfully raised $1 billion in a token sale, with proceeds used to cover the $850 million in (potentially) lost funds from Crypto Capital.",

Tether uses an IOU issuance model where each USDT represents a claim for $1.00 held in the Tether's reserves which users can redeem at any time.\n\nOn Bitcoin, USDT tokens are issued via the Omni Layer protocol, which is a protocol built as a layer over Bitcoin that allows for the issuance of tokens representing any kind of asset.  \n\nOn Ethereum, USDT tokens are issued using the <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/erc-20\">ERC-20</a> protocol standard for creating tokens on Ethereum. ERC-20 tokens include a common set of rules that define how a token can be transferred, approved, and requested. ",

Binance Coin is an ERC-20 token that was issued as part of an initial coin offering (ICO) to be used for discounted trading costs, with a percentage of the tokens burned every quarter.\n\nERC-20 tokens were replaced by native tokens when Binance launched Binance Chain, its own public blockchain, in April 2019. The team constructed Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange that allows traders to keep custody of their cash, on top of Binance Chain. Over time, the token has gained additional functionality, such as use in the Binance Launchpad lottery system and different payments in the Binance ecosystem.\n\nCEO Changpeng Zhao (\"CZ\") has also stated that 90% of Binance employees opt to earn a portion of their income in BNB.",

Binance was the first to offer discounts on these trading fees if they were paid in the native exchange token. The discount started at 50% for the first year getting reduced to 25% in the second, 12.5% in the third and finally 6.75% in the fourth before being eliminated entirely. These discounts are at the sole discretion of Binance and could be altered at any time.  \n\nLaunchpad\nAs a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-evolution-of-crypto-capital-markets\">progression </a>of the ICO, Binance first popularized the <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-exchange-offering-ieo\">initial exchange offering (IEO)</a> when they announced in January 2019 that they would be selling tokens directly through the exchange every month. Initially, the sales were done on a first come first serve basis. They since pivoted to a lottery system where users can claim tickets based on the number of BNB tokens held over the prior 20 days. The tickets represent a certain allocation of tokens and are drawn randomly. If selected, the user is committed to purchasing that number of tokens at the listed price. \n\nBinance Chain\nBNB acts as the native token used as gas to pay for network transactions on Binance Chain, a high-performance blockchain network. It initially operates with a small pre-selected validator set, but the plan is to transition to a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/delegated-proof-of-stake\">delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)</a> consensus mechanism where users can vote using their BNB for delegates that will validate blocks to secure the network. There is also a built-in governance module to let BNB holders submit proposals by depositing tokens which are then voted on. \n"

Half of the founders’ allocation was vested immediately. The other half is vested annually through 2021. From Q2 2019, these tokens will be burnt through quarterly burns and will thus remain illiquid until they are burnt.  Binance plans to burn 100 million BNB (50% of supply) over time and has successfully executed nine coin burns to date.\nInvestors receive 20 million BNB (10% of supply) with no vesting or lock-up restrictions. \nThe public sale distributed 100 million BNB (50% of supply). Binance launched the ERC-20 Binance Coin in a public sale on July 14, 2017. Half of the funds raised through Binance’s coin offering were intended for Binance branding and marketing, and roughly one-third of the funds were for platform upgrades and development.\n\nBinance executed the token swap from ERC-20 BNB tokens to Binance chain mainnet BNB coins on April 23, 2019. Binance Coins native to the Binance chain are called BEP2 BNB. Pre-selected validators produced blocks after the genesis block on April 18, 2019, and the first ERC-20 to BEP2 BNB swap of 5 million BNB was executed to a wallet belonging to Binance."

Nevertheless, in April 2019, Binance edited the white paper’s section devoted to quarterly repurchasing plans to replace it with a section on quarterly burn plans. In July 2019, Binance announced that it will burn the BNB tokens allocated to the Binance team going forward. As a result, the team allocation, that was initially supposed to be vesting for 4 years, will remain illiquid until all 80,000,000 BNB have been burnt. This reduces BNB's liquid supply, as these tokens are no longer liquid, but it also reduces the potential liquid supply inflation rate that would have occurred through the vesting of those tokens. \n\nAs of today, Binance has realized 15 quarterly token burns, leading to the destruction of 30,567,063 BNB:\n\nOctober 2017 - 986,000 BNB\nJanuary 2018 -  1,821,586 BNB\nApril 2018 -  2,220,314 BNB\nJuly 2018 -  2,528,767 BNB\nOctober 2018 - 1,643,986 BNB\nJanuary 2019 - 1,623,818 BNB.\nApril 2019 - 829,888 BNB\nJuly 2019 - 808,888 BNB\nOctober 2019 - 2,061,888 BNB\n10.

Binance forked Cosmos to create the Binance blockchain, which currently does not support smart contract features. Binance aims to use the Tendermint consensus framework to solve some interoperability problems with inter-blockchain communication (IBC). \n\nBinance chain source code is currently not open source for competitiveness reasons, according to Binance.

Solana features a new timestamp system called Proof-of-History (PoH) that enables automatically ordered transactions. It also uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to help secure the network. Additional design goals include sub-second settlement times, low transaction costs, and support for all LLVM compatible smart contract languages.",

            "background_details": "Solana's origins date back to late 2017 when founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper draft detailing a new timekeeping technique for distributed systems called Proof of History (PoH). In blockchains like Bitcoin and Etheruem, one of the limitations to scalability is the time required to reach a consensus on the order of transactions. Anatoly believed his new technique could automate the transaction ordering process for blockchains, providing a key piece that would enable crypto networks to scale well-beyond their capabilities at the time.\n\nAnatoly later teamed up with former Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald to build a single blockchain network in Rust that used PoH as its \"internal clock.\" The two released the first internal testnet (with demo) and official version of the project's whitepaper in Feb. 2018. Another former Qualcomm cohort, Stephen Akridge, suggested that offloading signature verification to graphics processors could further increase transaction throughput (i.e., scalability). Anatoly recruited Greg and Stephen, and three others to found the company that would eventually become Solana Labs. The founding team included former Apple engineers in addition to the Qualcomm veterans. They initially named the project Loom but later rebranded it to Solana to avoid confusion with the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, Loom Network.\n\nSolana Labs began raising funds to build its new crypto network in Q2 2018. Between Apr. 2018 and Jul. 2019, the team raised a little over $20 million in various private token sales. They announced the sales as a single Series A in late-July 2019. The fundraising effort ran parallel to Solana's work on the protocol, which went through several permissioned testnet phases before the team announced its public incentivized testnet, called Tour de SOL, in Q3 2020. The first stage of Tour de SOL went live in Feb. 2020, and it continues to run alongside the Mainnet Beta version of Solana today.\n\nSolana launched on Mainnet Beta in Mar. 2020, shortly after raising $1.76 million in a public token auction hosted on CoinList. The project's beta network featured basic transaction capabilities and smart contract support. But it did not include any staking rewards as Solana was still determining its ongoing issuance schedule. The current plan is to upgrade from its current beta stage to a more production-ready version in either later 2020 or early 2021.\n\nAt the moment, Solana Labs remains a core contributor to the Solana network, while the Solana Foundation helps fund ongoing development and community building efforts.",

The tokens issued in these sales should become liquid around Jan. 7, 2021. The project's public auction sale (held in Mar. 2020) did not come with a lockup schedule, and the SOL tokens distributed in that sale (which totaled 1.6% of the initial supply) were fully liquid once the network launched.\n\nThe founder's allocation (12.5% of the initial supply) will also be subject to a nine-month lockup post-network launch. After the lockup period ends, these tokens will vest monthly for another two years (expected to fully vest by Jan. 2023).\n\nThe Grant Pool and Community Reserve (both overseen by the Solana Foundation) contain ~38% of the initial SOL supply combined. These allocations began to vest in small amounts since Solana's mainnet launch. One million Grant Pool tokens vested every three months for the first nine months, and 35 million Community Reserve tokens vested in 5 million token increments over the same timeframe. The entire allocations for these categories will unlock in Jan. 2021.\n\nThe Solana Foundation's allocation began vesting in small increments every month following the network's launch. The foundation also unlocked 11,365,067 SOL at launch to lend to a market maker for six months. After disclosing this information to SOL holders, the team opted to burn an equivalent amount of tokens from the foundation's allocation.\n\nOngoing Emissions\nSolana validators voted to enable <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/61adff26-b903-4ab9-8329-952d6a555228\">\"pico-inflation\"</a> on Dec. 24, 2020. The SOL supply is now inflating at an annual rate of 0.1%, with newly minted tokens going to validators and stakers in proportion to their staked amounts. This relatively low inflation rate is only temporary and will be replaced by a more substantial and permanent inflation proposal at some point in 2021.\n\nThis \"final\" inflation proposal includes an initial annual inflation rate of 8%. However, this inflation rate will decrease at an annual rate of 15% (\"dis-inflation rate\"). Solana's inflation rate will continue to decrease until it reaches an annual rate of 1.5%, which the network should reach in about ten years or 2031. 1.5% will remain the long-term inflation rate for Solana unless the network's governance system votes to change it.",

The current network setting has around 400 milliseconds (ms) for one slot. Every 400ms, the network has a potential rollback point, but every subsequent vote doubles the amount of time that the network would have to stall before it can unroll that vote. In short, secondary votes make it much harder to undo the transactions executed in a particular slot. Therefore, a block with several votes has a greater chance of remaining a part of the chain permanently.\n\nAs an example, each validator has voted 32 times in the last 12 seconds. The vote 12 seconds ago now will have a timeout of 2³² slots or roughly 54 years. Effectively, this vote will never be rolled back by the network. Whereas the most recent vote has a timeout of two slots or about 800ms. As new blocks are added to the ledger, old blocks are increasingly likely to be confirmed because the number of slots old votes is committed to doubles every slot. Tower BTF offers finality once two-thirds of network validators have voted on some order of events. Once transactions are finalized, they can't be rolled back.\n\nThe Solana mainnet is planned to operate in delegated-Proof-of-Stake (dPoS), in which token holders can participate in the block production process and earn rewards by either stake token and become a validator themselves, or delegate their tokens to validators they trust.\n\nAny individual can become a validator on the network and contribute to the overall security of the protocol. There is no minimum staking requirement, although the leader selection process (which validator gets to propose the next block) is stake-weighted. The network architecture is designed to scale with bandwidth and hardware, utilizing GPU cores to parallelize execution and reduce verification times. Due to the GPU requirement, hardware expectations are slightly higher than some protocols. Estimated costs for a satisfactory setup are around $5,000.",

          "overview": {
            "technology_details": "Solana’s highly performant blockchain is built using the eight innovations:\nProof of History: A clock before consensus\nTower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT\nTurbine: A block propagation protocol\nGulfstream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol\nSealevel: World’s first parallel smart contracts run-time\nPipelining: Transaction processing unit for validation\nCloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database\nArchivers: Distributed ledger storage\n\nProof of History: A clock before consensus\nThe biggest challenge in distributed networks is agreeing on the time and sequence in which events occurred as nodes within the network can’t trust the timestamp on messages received from other nodes. Solana attempts to solve this with Proof of History (PoH) by creating a cryptographically secure source of time across the network. Proof of History is a high-frequency Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), which requires a specific number of sequential steps to evaluate but produces a unique output that can be publicly verified. This means that nodes can create the next block without having to coordinate with the entire network first because they can trust the timestamp and ordering of the messages that they’ve received. The result is a reduction in consensus overhead.\n\nTower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT\nOn top of Proof of History, Solana runs its consensus mechanism called Tower BFT, which is a PBFT-like algorithm that leverages the synchronized clock enabled by PoH to achieve consensus on network transactions. At a high level, each time a node on the network votes on a particular fork, they commit to a certain amount of time where they are locked out from voting on an opposing fork. This period where they are locked out grows exponentially as they continue to vote on the same fork until they achieve a maximum lockout at 32 votes for the same fork. Nodes on the network will only receive inflation rewards when they reach this maximum vote lockout; therefore, it is in their interest to continue voting on the fork they believe the supermajority of the network is voting for.\n\nTurbine: A block propagation protocol\nSolana transmits blocks (communicates blocks between validators) independently of consensus, using a separate but connected protocol called Turbine. Turbine borrows heavily from BitTorrent and is optimized for streaming. As a block is streamed, it is broken up into small packets along with erasure codes, and then fanned out across a large set of random peers.\n\nGulf Stream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol\nIn a high-performance network, mempool management presents a new class of problems when it comes to the cost of filtering and maintaining a rising number of unconfirmed transactions. Gulf Stream functions by pushing transaction caching and forwarding to the edge of the network. Since every validator knows the order of upcoming leaders (block producers) in Solana architecture, clients and validators forward transactions to the expected leader ahead of time. This allows validators to execute transactions ahead of time, reduce confirmation times, switch leaders faster, and reduce the memory pressure on validators from the unconfirmed transaction pool. One consequence of knowing leaders ahead of time is an increased risk of validator collusion since the network allows more time for them to coordinate. Solana's fast block times might mitigate the opportunity for collusion because it limits the time allowed to plan an attack. \n\nSealevel: Parallel smart contracts run-time\nSolana built Sealevel, a hyper parallelized transaction processing engine designed to scale horizontally across GPUs and SSDs. Most other blockchains are single-threaded computers. In contrast, Solana can support parallel transaction execution (in addition to signature verification) in a single shard. The solution to this problem borrows heavily from an operating system driver technique called scatter-gather. Transactions specify upfront what state they will read and write while executing. Sealevel is able to find the non-overlapping transactions occurring in a block and execute them in parallel (called parallel execution) while optimizing how read and writes to the state are scheduled across an array of RAID 0 SSDs. Sealevel is a VM that schedules transactions, but it doesn’t actually execute transactions in the VM. Instead, Sealevel hands off transactions to be executed on hardware natively using bytecode called the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF).\n\nPipeline: A Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization\nThe process of transaction validation on the Solana network makes extensive use of an optimization common in CPU design called pipelining. Pipelining is an appropriate process when there’s a stream of input data that needs to be processed by a sequence of steps and there’s different hardware responsible for each step. On the Solana network, the pipeline mechanism, the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), progresses through Data Fetching at the kernel level, Signature Verification at the GPU level, Banking at the CPU level, and Writing at the kernel space. By the time the TPU starts to send blocks out to the validators, it’s already fetched in the next set of packets, verified their signatures, and begun crediting tokens. The GPU parallelization in this four-stage pipeline allows the Solana TPU to operate at a high performance.\n\nCloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database\nMethods to scale computation using these other innovations could result in memory bottlenecks. Memory is used to keep track of accounts and can struggle to maintain performance due to a lack of memory size and limited access speeds. Cloudbreak was designed to optimize for concurrent reads and writes spread across a RAID 0 configuration of SSDs. Each additional disk adds storage capacity available to on-chain programs, while also increasing the number of concurrent reads and writes programs can perform when executing. This goes hand in hand with Solana’s transaction design, allowing for pre-fetching accounts from disk and preparing the runtime for execution, also enabling nodes on the network to begin executing transactions before they are encoded into a block. All of this aims to help reduces block times and confirmation latency on the network.\n\nArchivers: Distributed ledger storage\nStoring and maintaining data on a high-performance network is likely to become a primary centralization vector. If storage costs are very high, only well-funded entities will be able to act as validators and participate in consensus. On Solana, data storage is offloaded from validators to a network of nodes called Archivers. Archivers do not participate in consensus. The history of the state is broken into many pieces and erasure codes. Archivers store small parts of the state. Every so often, the network will ask the Archivers to prove that they’re storing the data they are supposed to. Solana leverages Proofs of Replication (PoRep), which are borrowed heavily from Filecoin. Archivers are not currently implemented and are on the long term roadmap. They will be rolled out based on network data demands.",

The project was launched out of the insight that the industry needed a fiat-collateralized stablecoin with strong governance and transparency, in contrast to <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/tether\">Tether</a>. USDC attempts to solve these issues by publishing a monthly public attestation of 100% reserves of fiat tokens on CENTRE.io, and providing clear rules and guidelines for CENTRE members regarding USDC issuance and redemption. Furthermore to become an issuer within the CENTRE consortium members must follow key membership and operating rules which include licensing, compliance, technology & operations, accounting, and custody of fiat reserves.\n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDC as an alternative to fiat currencies, outsourcing the need to maintain banking relationships. Furthermore, USDC is one of the only fiat-collateralized stablecoins available for use in the burgeoning <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-finance-defi\">DeFi</a> ecosystem.",

Customers who on-board through a stablecoin on-ramp, such as a web application created and maintained by a licensed CENTRE token-issuing member, can transfer fiat funds into that CENTRE issuer’s account. The issuer then executes a series of commands with the CENTRE network to verify, mint, and validate fiat tokens pegged to the value of those deposited funds. The customer can then transfer those tokens elsewhere in order to use them. Redemption follows the reverse sequence: fiat tokens are burned when a customer visits an off-ramp such as a web application maintained by a licensed CENTRE issuing member. Upon successful verification and validation, funds from underlying fiat reserves would be transferred to the customer’s external bank.\n",

The project was introduced on Twitter by Jackson Palmer on November 27, 2013 when he tweeted about \"investing\" on “Dogecoin”, a made-up name. Some of Palmer's friends encouraged him to create a real Dogecoin project, so he registered dogecoin.com and started working. Billy Markus saw the website and reached out to Palmer. Markus and Palmer thought Dogecoin would make the cryptocurrency space more palletable to newcomers since, as they built the protocol, Bitcoin was beleaguered by associations with Silk Road and dark web. Palmer exited the Dogecoin project and community in June 2014 by tweeting, \"Unsubshibing. Peace.\"\n\nUnlike a variety of other altcoins launched in 2013 and 2014, Dogecoin has proved itself surprisingly resilient to crypto-asset market cycles, which is speculated to be the result of meme durability.

New blocks are added to the chain every 60 seconds, on average. \n\nDogecoin uses scrypt hash function for its proof-of-work consensus mechanism. The scrypt algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale, custom-hardware attacks. At launch, Dogecoin was mine-able on personal computers, which was attractive to cryptocurrency enthusiasts during a time when Bitcoin mining was increasingly industrialized and capital intensive. \n\nDogecoin has no formal white paper, although several fans have written blog and forum posts as stand-in explainer documents.

In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n",

It separates the system into several core modules, including the underlying network, data storage, consensus, transaction actuator, TVM, and application layer interface.\n\nThe end result is that this enables, through the DPoS consensus algorithm, a maximum of 2,000 TPS.\n\nThe underlying network module is a set of customizable and efficient message response systems, built based on Netty, a high-performance network framework. Network module is separated into two modules: Node discovery is implemented based on the Kademlia algorithm. It meets the requirements of node discovery in decentralized network environments and can defend eclipse and witch attacks by a set of node scoring mechanism. Node communication module uses TCP for data transfer. Based on this, a flexible and extensible message registration response mechanism is designed on the business layer.\n\nBlocks are categorized as solidified and un-solidified block to tap the performance potential of the public chain. It can reduce the limits of the CAP theory of distributed systems and give the most consideration to data availability and consistency.  \n\nSolidified blocks cannot be rolled back. Un-solidified blocks contain the latest transaction data. Full nodes provide data inquiry services for both types of blocks to meet various needs from users.\n\n",

            "background_details": "Cardano is an open-source blockchain originating from peer-reviewed academic research. Cardano does not have a single published white paper but is developed from a collection of academic papers. Cardano sees itself as a “third-generation” protocol, improving on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first and second generations, respectively. Cardano is named after an Italian Renaissance mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, and its native currency ADA is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician sometimes referenced as the first computer programmer. \n\nCardano is backed by three entities: IOHK, The Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. IOHK is a blockchain research and development company founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood that is contracted to work on Cardano from 2015 through 2020. The Cardano Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on core development and ecosystem growth for Cardano. Emurgo is a Japanese venture capital firm. \n\nCardano's full launch will consist of five phases: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. The Byron era arrived in September 2017 with the mainnet launch of the Cardano blockchain. During this phase, the chain operated as a federated network that only supported ADA transactions. The next phase, Shelley, launched in July 2020, bringing Cardano's proposed Ouroboros Proas Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol to life.

Therefore, any block rewards generated during this initial phase were burned (no inflation during Byron). \n\nThe Byron era also saw the delivery of the Daedalus wallet, IOHK's official desktop wallet for ADA, as well as Yoroi, a light wallet built by Emurgo for quick transactions and day-to-day use."

Cardano plans to release a Shelley mainnet candidate chain around Jun. 23 before releasing the code to mainnet on the Jun. 30 target date. The official hard fork that will activate Shelley’s changes could arrive on Jul. 29, which would give network participants enough time to upgrade their nodes and wallets.

The goal is to improve the underlying performance of Cardano to better support growth and adoption for applications that require high transaction volumes.\n\nTwo of the primary developments proposed for the Bash era are sidechains and parallel accounting styles. Sidechains are new blockchains (like shard chains) that interoperate with the main chain. They can help off-load work from this base layer to increase the overall capacity of the network (scalability through parallel computation). While Cardano uses a UTXO model, sidechains will also have the ability to support account-based models. By having parallel accounting styles, Cardano might be able to interoperate with external networks more easily or support new kinds of uses cases."

Token holders, either through direct staking or a delegation system, will then be able to vote on which proposals the network should implement. Voltaire will also see the addition of a treasury system, whereby a fraction of all transaction fees will be pooled to provide funds for development activities undertaken following the voting process.",

Chainlink aims to solve the oracle problem, an inherent limitation of blockchain networks that prevents them from connecting to external data resources that exist off-chain. Through a decentralized network of independent oracle node operators, Chainlink provides a wide range of decentralized services to smart contracts including Price Feeds (financial market data used to power a large portion of the DeFi economy), verifiable randomness (enabling the creation of dynamic NFTs and fair on-chain gaming applications), proof of reserve (providing proofof off-chain collateral that is backing stablecoins and cross-chain tokens), the Keeper Network (transaction automation bots that provide autonomous DevOps services), and more. \n\nThe recently released Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper also broadens the capabilities of Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) and describes how the Chainlink Network is evolving to provide both tamper-proof data delivery and secure off-chain computation. Chainlink oracle networks enable the creation of highly scalable and privacy-preserving hybrid smart contracts that combine on-chain and off-chain infrastructure. Off-Chain Reporting, a recent scalability upgrade of the Chainlink Network that lowered the gas costs of oracle updates by 90%, represents the first move towards achieving the goals laid out in the whitepaper.",

Chainlink is not a monolithic network like a blockchain but rather an infrastructure and framework for building blockchain-agnostic oracle networks that augment the capabilities of blockchains and layer-2 protocols.\n\nEach Chainlink oracle network consists of multiple independent oracle nodes that fetch data from multiple independent data providers, aggregate the data into a single data point, and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by smart contracts. Chainlink's flexible architecture allows for highly configurable oracle networks that can be composed of any selection of node operators and data providers and that use different network parameters such as update frequency, fee payment amounts, and more.\n\nChainlink nodes are operated by professional DevOps infrastructure providers, leading enterprises, and premium data providers who supply smart contracts with access to cryptographically signed data for additional security guarantees. Because of its flexible design, Chainlink can provide any type of data or computation to any smart contract application operating on any blockchain network.",

          "background": {
            "background_details": "As early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/block-size\">block size</a> began. However, discussions around the block limit largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. Supporters of bigger blocks believed that for Bitcoin to fulfill the vision of a peer-to-peer electronic currency as outlined in the original whitepaper, it was crucial to raise the block limit in order to increase transaction capacity. Bitcoin Cash proponents pushed for a system that could scale to VISA level transaction throughput without second layers and while maintaining affordable transaction fees. It rejected the philosophy of Bitcoin Core that Bitcoin's central value proposition is censorship resistance and trust-minimization, and that Bitcoin full nodes needed to be maximally decentralized to achieve this. Instead of envisioning Bitcoin as a settlement layer or a Digital Gold, Bitcoin Cash envisions Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, emphasizing Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange.\n\nIn 2017 at the Consensus conference amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly tense debate around the Bitcoin block limit, a meeting with miners and Core Developers took place in what is referred to as the “New York Agreement”, where an agreement was reached to support <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> and a 2MB <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\">hard fork</a>. Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. Despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. They set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/soft-fork\">soft fork</a> to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017 they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. The 8MB block limit was later increased to 32MB in 2018 after another contentious hard fork regarding a minority faction's desire to raise the block limit to 128MB. This hard fork resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV, a fork of Bitcoin Cash. \n\nAlthough increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\">nodes</a>, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. In addition to pursuing on-chain scalability through larger block sizes, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes fast-paced development of technological improvements in opposition to the more conservative philosophy of Bitcoin. To date, Bitcoin Cash has 6 competing node implementations: BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, BXT, Parity, Bitprim, and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash has also had a variety of upgrades, the most recent of which taking place of 05/15/2021. This upgrade made a variety of changes including the removal of the unconfirmed transaction limit, the enabling multiple OP_RETURNS, the implementation of double-spend proofs, , the inclusion of Cash Improvement Proposals (CHIPs) to introduce new specification changes to the protocol, and the inclusion of a new mining block default limit size of 8 MB.

As such, it went through two halvings to date; in November 2012, and again in July 2016, each cutting the initial block reward by half. On average, Bitcoin Cash generates new blocks every 10 minutes, rewarding miners with 12.5 new BCH and the total transaction fees from the preceding block. Each block has a 32MB limit and block rewards are <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/halving\">halved </a>every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years). Eventually, once the 21 million BCH hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for BCH. Bitcoin Cash's next halving is expected to happen in May 2020.\n\nThe difference between BCH and BTC supply curves since the fork can be explained by the difficulty adjustment algorithm which included one addition compared to Bitcoin: the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA). This mechanism was set by the Bitcoin Cash developers to incentivize miners to prioritize BCH’s transactions over that of BTC’s. Miners leveraged this mechanism to maximize their profit by reducing their BCH mining output while waiting for the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment to reduce BCH’s difﬁculty, which in turn would lead to higher returns. As a result, 120,000 more BCH than BTC were mined from August 01, 2017, until November 13, 2017, when Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm. \n\n",

            "technology_details": "Bitcoin Cash, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of unspent transaction output (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 32MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (<a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/mempool\">mempool</a>) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin Cash's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\">difficulty</a> adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin Cash uses a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work</a> (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. \n\n",

          "governance_details": "Bitcoin Cash developement is open to the open-source community. Although largely driven by Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Cash has 6 different client implementations. Protocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin Cash community can submit draft proposals. After debate by the community, the client implementation editors accept or reject the proposals. Decisions from the process are written into the Bitcoin Cash specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Finally, protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus. \n\nAlthough very similar to Bitcoin overall, as opposed to users signaling support of upgrades, Bitcoin Cash tends to use hash power signaling to indicate support of network upgrades. Furthermore, Bitcoin Cash implements planned upgrades on a bi-annual basis as part of its more progressive network upgrade philosophy",

The Stellar blockchain allows anyone to issue new assets in the network and exchange for other assets via built-in asset exchange features. Assets on Stellar are issued and redeemed by anchors, who are trusted entities that issue digital credits on the Stellar network in exchange for deposits of the asset with the trusted entity. Anchors enable real world assets to be exchanged on Stellar by leveraging a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\">distributed exchange</a> that maintains an order book for every asset pair. Stellar supports the issuance of any type of asset including stocks, currencies, cryptoassets and more.\n",

With the creation of the non-for profit <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/stellar-development-foundation\">Stellar Development Foundation</a> (SDF), the team aimed to \"promote global financial access, literacy, and inclusion...and create an open and affordable financial system where people of all income levels can access simple-to-use, secure, and low cost financial services.\" The Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. Stripe invested $3 million in seed funding and received 2 billion Stellar Lumens (XLM) in exchange. At launch the network generated 100 billion XLM and featured a 1% annual issuance rate. \n\nIn 2015, Stellar redesigned its consensus protocol following a ledger fork in 2014 that rolled back hours of transactions. It's new and current consensus protocol called \"Stellar Consensus Protocol\" was developed by Stanford professor <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-mazi-res\">David Mazières</a>, chief scientist of the SDF. In 2017, Jed McCaleb and Brit Yonge launched <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/interstellar\">Lightyear</a> as a for-profit entity of Stellar, that would build a universal payment network on Stellar. In 2017, Stellar announced a grants program that would award partners up to $2 million worth of Lumens for project development.\n\nIn October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\nIn November 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/stellar-development-foundation-burns-more-than-half-of-lumen-supply-with-new-strategy-focus\">announced</a> it burned more than 55 billion XLM (~55%) tokens as it moves away from airdrop programs. Previously the foundation had retained 68 billion XLM earmarked for giveaways in order to grow the community. Citing a declining utility from airdrops, the SDF burned 50 billion of those tokens along with 5 billion of the 17 billion previously held in its operating fund. The burn reduced the total supply to 50 billion XLM of which SDF's ownership of the total dropped from XLM supply from 85% to 60%.\n",

Nevertheless, those distribution mechanisms initially designed by the SDF proved hard to effectively execute:\nOut of the 20 billion XLM to be distributed to Bitcoin holders (19 billion) and XRP holders (1 billion), only 2.037 billion were distributed in two rounds, in October 2016 and August 2017. The rest (17.963 billion) was re-allocated to the SDF operational budget in 2017. As such, the SDF increased its operational budget, initially set at 3 billion XLM by 600% through this re-allocation. \nOut of the 50 billion XLM to be distributed through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 4.2 billion XLM, less than 10% of what was originally planned. \nOut of the 25 billion XLM to be distributed through the Partnership program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 1.138 billion XLM, less than 5% of what was originally planned. It's also interesting to note that the address that received this 1.138 billion XLM sent then back to the SDF-managed address in November 2019, right before the SDF burnt 55 billion XLM, as detailed below. \n\nGlobally, the SDF only managed to distribute 7.375 billion XLM through these three programs, instead of the 95 billion initially scheduled. \n\nBuilt-in Inflation Mechanism\n\nUntil October 2019, the Stellar ledger also featured a built-in, fixed, nominal inflation mechanism. New Lumens were added to the network at a rate of 1% each year. Each week, the protocol would distribute these Lumens to any account that receives over 0.05% of the “votes” from other accounts in the network.  Given the very high supply concentration within the SDF treasury addresses due to the inefficiency of the distribution mechanisms, the SDF would receive over 95% of the votes, and thus 95% of the built-in inflation, increasing its operational budget by more than 4 billion XLM thanks to this built-in inflation mechanism. In October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\n2017 Inflation Exploit\n\nFrom January to April 2017, Stellar suffered a serious inflation bug, <a href=\"https://messari.io/c/research/stellar-s-2017-inflation-exploit\">discovered in 2019 by Messari</a>. The bug was exploited, significantly inflationary, and patched with little publicity in April 2017. The attacker was able to create over 2.2 billion Lumens worth nearly $10 million at the time. Once it discovered and patched the bug, the SDF destroyed the equivalent number of coins that were created through the bug. Nevertheless, the XLM burned to offset the inflation bug came from the Direct Sing-up program allocation. As such, the SDF burnt supply that was meant to be distributed to the crowd to offset an inflation bug that was exploited by an attacker.\n\nOverhang burning\n\nConscious of the difficulty the distribute this important supply overhang, the SDF decided to burn more than 55 billion XLM in November 2019.\n37.6 billion XLM were burned from the Direct Sign-up Program allocation, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 4 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distributing 50 billion XLM through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8.2 billion XLM (4.2 billion distributed from 2015 to 2019 and 4 billion left to be distributed). \n12.988 billion XLM were burned from the Partnership program, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 8 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distribution 25 billion XLM through the Partnership program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8 billion XLM. \n4.88 billion XLM were burned from the SDF operational budget. Nevertheless, this burn only offset the newly issued XLM received through the built-in inflation during the first 5 years of the protocol. \n\nThrough this burn, the SDF reduced the maximum supply from 105 billion XLM to 50 billion XLM.

Quorum is a set of nodes sufficient to reach agreement. Given that an FBA system is open participation, meaning that participants can join and leave as they please, it is impossible for the system to know how many nodes are sufficient for quorum without knowing the identities and amounts of nodes in the system. Thus, FBA introduces a concept of quorum slices nodes. A quorum slice is a subset of a quorum that can convince one particular node about agreement. In an FBA system nodes broadcast and individually determine which quorums slices to trust, and build their own quorum based on the information they have at hand. In FBA systems it is crucial that these quoroms overlap to ensure the network reaches consensus. Ripple for example, provides a list of trusted validators to use in order ensure there is overlap when participating in the Ripple Consensus Protocol (RCP). \n\nConsensus in FBA systems is reached through a multi round process where validators share ledger candidates between each other, adding and subtracting transactions until their candidate proposals match what their validators in their quorom slice proposed. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results. Once a super majority of validators agree upon the hash of the new ledger candidate, the ledger candidate is considered final.\n\nSCP differentiates itself from RCP in that validators can choose their own quorom slices rather than using a pre-defined one (from Ripple). Furthermore, rather than relying on a super majority of nodes for consensus SCP introduces notions of validator quality, where validators are weighted based on trustworthiness and reliability, and validator grouping, where validators are grouped by organization. SCP posit these additions allow for stronger quorums.\n",

The FBA is a fairly new consensus mechanism pioneered by Ripple. The SCP is the first provable safe FBA blockchain protocol.\n\nAn FBA allows nodes to choose which peers the trust based on intrinsic or extrinsic factors set by the nodes. This dynamic creates network-wide quorums as individual nodes relay and verify network activity information. FBAs rely on “quorum slices” to reach consensus—subsets of a quorum that can convince an individual node to agree with the “slice.” Stellar nodes can choose their own quorum slices.\n\nTo attack the Stellar network, a reputable institution would need to control 51% or more of the network’s trusted nodes. Stellar disinventivizes this by financial rewarding honest actors in the network via fees and other rewards. Stellar also adds an element of reputation and social identity by keeping network actors as known entities, which incentivizes financial institutions to maintain the trust of their peers.\n\nSome of these trusted financial institutions are called Anchors, a crucial part of the Stellar blockchain network. Anchors maintain wallets with fiat and XLM balances to allow currency exchange. Anchors control the fees they charge for network peers to use their services, and users can pick which anchor manages their exchanges.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain also supports launching native assets similar to issuing tokens on Ethereum. Compared to Ethereum, Stellar aims to offer faster transactions and lower network fees. All assets on the Stellar blockchain are not traded only by exchanging credits across between accounts in the network that are managed by anchors. ",

Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) deal with changes to the standards, protocols, and methods used in the ecosystem built on top of the Stellar network.

The SDF sets the project roadmap, acts as a steward of the Stellar network, and builds constructive relationships with governments and financial institutions worldwide.

SDF was created in collaboration with Stripe, which provided $3 million in seed funding, and is financed by Stellar Lumens.

The research was led by Emin Gün Sirer, a professor of computer science and software engineer, assisted by doctoral students Maofan \"Ted\" Yin and Kevin Sekniqi. Following the research stage, Ava Labs was founded to develop the network primarily to meet complex financial industry requirements. In March 2020, the AVA codebase for the Avalanche consensus protocol became open-source and available to the public.   \n\nIn addition to meeting complex financial industry requirements, Avalanche targets three broad use cases:\n\n– Building application-specific blockchains, spanning permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) deployments.\n– Building and launching highly scalable and decentralized applications (Dapps).\n– Building arbitrarily complex digital assets with custom rules, covenants, and riders (smart assets).\n\nAvalanche's Initial Coin Offering ended on July 15, 2020, followed by the launch of mainnet in September of the same year. In September 2020, the protocol also issued the native token AVAX (an acronym for \"Avalanche\"). Ultimately, Avalanche is designed to be a high-performing, scalable, customizable, and secure blockchain platform.",

              "consensus_details": "Avalanche utilizes a DAG-optimized novel family of Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols collectively called Snow. The family consists of three components – Slush, Snowflake, and Snowball. Snowflake and Snowball are leaderless Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols built around Slush, a non-BFT metastable mechanism. Inspired by gossip algorithms, consensus gains its properties through the metastable mechanism whereby the system operates by repeatedly sampling the network at random and steering correct nodes towards a common outcome. \n\nThe metastable mechanism aims to quickly move a large network to an irreversible state, where the irreversibility implies that a sufficiently large portion of the network has accepted a proposal, and a conflicting proposal will not be accepted with any higher than negligible probability. \n\nIn simple terms, Avalanche's consensus is leaderless by design. Transactions are verified by having nodes communicate with each other at random until a sufficiently large portion of them reach an agreement. A validator's chance of being sampled is proportional to their AVAX stake. A validator will receive a staking reward if they are online and respond for more than 80% of their validation period, as measured by a majority of validators. The minimum amount that a validator must stake is 2,000 AVAX. Avalanche's leaderless design allows it to waive slashing penalties, which can otherwise act as a deterrent to prospective stakers. Ultimately, this approach is aimed at maximizing its total validator set.\n\nFurther, because Avalanche is a lightweight protocol, the minimum computer requirements are quite modest and do not require special computer hardware.\n\n· Hardware: 8 core CPU   = 2 GHz, RAM: 16 GB, Storage: 200 GB free space.\n· OS: Ubuntu   = 18.04 or Mac OS X   = Catalina. (Ubuntu versions older than 18.04 may work but have not been tested.)\n· Network: IPv4 or IPv6 network connection, with an open public port, capable of at least 30Mbps throughput.\n\nRequirements scale with the amount of AVAX staked on the node. A large node (100k+ AVAX staked) gets the most significant instance to ensure the node doesn't fall behind and jeopardize staking rewards. A small node (less than 10k AVAX staked) can run a healthy node on a below-spec computer.",

Avalanche uses Proof-of-Stake, allowing validators to have a first-hand say in the system while consuming minimal energy. Avalanche is not a single chain network. It features multiple chains, with some performing core functions while others are more application-specific. All non-core Avalanche chains (called subnets) must rely on validators that stake AVAX on one of Avalanche’s central platforms. Validators must be a member of the Primary Network; all other subnets are optional. The Primary Network contains three blockchains: \n\nPlatform Chain (P-Chain) \nContract Chain (C-Chain) \nExchange Chain (X-Chain) \n\nAll three combine to provide the same capabilities of a single network. The X-Chain handles the creation of new digital assets and the exchange of tokens between the core blockchains and their various subnets. The C-Chain is an instance of Ethereum’s EVM, which allows for the creation and execution of Solidity-based applications. The last chain, known as the P-Chain, is the base staking platform that manages network validators and enables developers to create new subnets. Every validator must stake on the P-Chain and participate in securing Avalanche’s Primary Network.",

            "project_details": "Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger of transactions, otherwise known as a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt\">DLT</a> (distributed ledger technology). While blockchains are the most commonly used DLTs, Hedera is slightly different since it uses a new consensus algorithm known as hashgraph. The hashgraph consensus algorithm aims to process and finalize more transactions at scale than traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks, as they are often characterized by high latency and low transactions per second (tps). Hedera's state is stored on mainnet nodes, which are all currently run by members of the Hedera Governing Council. But in the future, mainnet nodes will be permissionless. These nodes secure the Hedera ledger by reaching a consensus on the validity and order of transactions.\n\nHedera provides two core network services: the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) and the Hedera Token Service (HTS). HCS allows clients to submit messages to the Hedera network for consensus timestamping and ordering, but it doesn't require the consensus nodes to store state related to that message. Instead, application state or data is persisted off-chain, where HCS users can define confidentiality and access control that cater to their use-case. The HTS supports native tokenization, whereby clients can create and manage various token types. Token controls include managing supply and KYC compliance, along with native atomic swaps and multi-sig capabilities.",

            "background_details": "Hedera Hashgraph Vision\nHashgraph is a relatively new consensus protocol that aims to process transactions faster than existing networks. Hedera layers Proof-of-Stake for consensus weighting, a fee & rewards model, a cryptocurrency, and the two key HCS and HTS services on top of hashgraph, Hedera's consensus algorithm. Since hashgraph has the potential to process transactions at a comparatively efficient rate, Hedera intends to be a platform that can support high-volume use cases, such as micropayments, data integrity, and tokenization. The network also supports a virtual machine that can compile smart contracts written in Solidity, similar to the EVM. Hedera intends to be compliant across jurisdictions by offering native support for optional KYC and AML checks via its \"Verified Identity\" mechanism.\n\nHedera will launch in a permissioned model with only the governing members running nodes. Over time, as the distribution of the network's native token, HBAR, improves, the node membership will transition from permissioned to fully permissionless, where any network participant can operator a Hedera consensus node.\n\nEntities Behind the Network\nHedera Hashgraph LLC is a US-based entity that is governed by 39 term-limited global enterprises across multiple industries. These entities manage Hedera's consensus nodes while collaborating to determine the protocol's future direction (i.e., Hedera's near-term governance model). Governing members are responsible for council membership, regulating network rules and tokens, and approving changes to the protocol. They also elect subcommittees that will operate traditional corporate functions such as Legal, Finance, and Marketing departments. Governing members receive fees from operating nodes to compensate for their security and governance contributions, but they do not take profits from the entity in their role as members.\n\nSwirlds is a separate company that owns the intellectual property of the hashgraph consensus algorithm and is an equal-weight governing member. Swirlds has licensed the technology to Hedera Hashgraph. The two entities will use the associated patent rights to legally prohibit anyone from forking the code and creating a competing platform and currency. While the consensus algorithm is not open source, it is \"open review,\" meaning anyone can verify there are no backdoors in the code. Additionally, Hedera's platform and services code, as well as developer tools, are all open source under the Apache 2.0 license. Using GitHub developers can make a \"Hedera Improvement Proposal\" (HIP) which members of the community can vote on.",

Fees serve to inhibit DoS (Denial of Service) attacks by making such attacks financially prohibitive. Fees are denominated in USD but charged in HBAR. The exchange rate between the two is updated hourly to give clients stability in prices irrespective of fluctuation in HBAR price.\nNetwork Security via Staking: A node's influence towards the determination of consensus timestamp and order is weighted by the number of HBARs the node itself has in its account and (to be implemented at a future date) the number of HBARs that other non-node accounts proxy to that node.\nIncentivizing Security (Staking Rewards): Nodes (and those that proxy their HBARs to nodes) will receive daily reward payments as per the participation in validating transactions during that period."

Before the Hedera network opened to the public, 6.7 million HBAR were set aside for the community testing program, while the rest remained in the Hedera Treasury account. When the network opened access to the public on Sept. 16, 2019, 45.09% of the total 50 billion HBAR were allocated to early management, employees (current and future), SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) investors, advisors, community earn programs, and enterprise and developer grants. The rest (54.91%) remained in the Hedera Treasury.\n\nPrivate SAFTs\nHedera issued three SAFTs, with the first SAFT being offered in December 2017 and the final SAFT round closing in August 2018. In the aggregate, 17.45% of all HBAR were sold in these private rounds. Hedera’s co-founders and early executives also acquired tokens through a SAFT as part of their compensation. Dr. Baird and Mr. Harmon (“The Founders”) each have a coin grant of two billion HBAR in total allocation (4% of total supply), each vesting over six years. Other senior executives who joined Hedera prior to March 2018 received an aggregate of 3.5% of the total coin supply via SAFTs and coin grants.\n\nAdditional Allocations\nHedera compensated employees, advisors, vendors, and other service providers in the form of Restricted Coin Units (RCUs), whereby individuals vest into a right to receive a select amount of HBAR. Hedera created a reserve of 8.1 billion HBAR for the coin plan that covers RCUs.\n\nHedera issued Swirlds (which owns patents on the hashgraph technology) a one-time allocation of 5% of the total supply of HBAR and allocated 1.24 billion tokens to the developer community and ecosystem reserve funds.\n\nNo more than 34% of the total HBAR is expected to be released until 2025.\n\nHedera will remain a permissioned network until the total value of all the circulating HBAR is high enough to be prohibitively expensive for a malicious user (or group of users) to acquire enough tokens to conduct an attack."

The initial two rounds of SAFTs have long release schedules of three to four years, while the final SAFT round offered a choice between a four-year release schedule and an eight-month release schedule. The first two SAFT seed rounds were at a price of close to zero dollars. The third SAFT was available with two pricing options and different release schedules, either 12 cents for a release schedule over 8 months or 9.6 cents for a 4-year release. \n\nThe maximum outstanding supply (50,000,000,000 HBARs) was minted at launch.\nIt is allocated as follows:\n\nHedera Treasury - 32.4% - Majority approval of council members is required prior to distribution.\n\nEcosystem Development - 24.0% - To accelerate development of the Hedera ecosystem.\n\nPurchase Agreements - 17.4% - Prior sale of Hedera tokens via Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (\"SAFTs\") will be distributed to investors according to lock-up agreements.\n\nFounders & Early Execs - 13.8% - Given to Mance Harmon and Leemon Baird, and early senior executives. \n\nSwirlds - 8.0% - Allocated to pay license fees and for Swirlds' investors.\n\nEmployees & Service Providers - 4.4% - Hedera tokens with the purpose of attracting and retaining talented employees.",

              "consensus_details": "The Hashgraph consensus algorithm is used for consensus on the Hedera Mainnet. The Hashgraph consensus algorithm is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT). Every node participates in every round of consensus, meaning it doesn't rely on a single node or \"leader\" to order transactions each round. The consensus is ''fair in that it doesn’t allow a leader to censor or unduly delay a given transaction.\n\nIn addition to ordering transactions, Hashgraph also issues a consensus timestamp for each transaction, calculated as the time at which the transaction reached a majority of the network. Once the consensus timestamp is determined then the transaction is final, which contrasts most Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks that rely on probabilistic finality. A formal proof of the consensus algorithm is available here. Hedera's fee model is not auction-based, a common model among most networks for submitting transactions. Without the concept of a fee auction, users can't pay more in fees to increase the likelihood of their transactions being ordered before transactions that may have been submitted earlier.\n\nHashgraph aims to process a high number of transactions per second (TPS) with low latency. The team has said Hedera's hashgraph consensus allows it to support over 10,000 transactions per second. The nature of these transactions has been disputed, as the 10,000 number may only represent cryptocurrency transactions and not any smart contract interactions. These disputes can be found here and here, while the Hedera team has issued a few rebuttals here and here.\n\nAs for how Hedera achieves this reportedly high TPS, it leverages two core components within Hashgraph: gossip about gossip and virtual voting. These components, along with weighting votes by stake, enable nodes to determine the consensus order of transactions. More information can be found here.",

            "technology_details": "Hashgraph Consensus\nHedera uses hashgraph consensus, an alternative to blockchain consensus mechanisms. It achieves a lower latency on transaction finality because once consensus on the timestamp and order of transactions is reached, those transactions are applied to the state in that order. Hashgraphs attempts to remove the reliance on fee-based auctions for transaction inclusion, which can lead to greater fees when the native token fluctuates in price and the potential for higher levels of MEV (miner extractable value).\n\nConsensus Nodes\nHedera's public ledger being stored and run by the Hedera Governing Council. While running mainnet node is currently limited to Council members, Hedera eventually plans to make its network permissionless, allowing any participant to run a consensus node. Hedera nodes come to consensus on the validity and order of transactions. When the network transitions to a permissionless state, the influence of each node towards consensus will be weighted by the number of HBAR in their account. Hedera will run PoS (Proof-of-Stake) but without any stake bonding or slashing penalties. Hashgraph will function as the consensus and security layer, while the PoS layer will deter DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.\n\nConsensus nodes (currently run by Council members) will receive daily payments to compensate for their bandwidth, storage, and computing costs. These daily payments will be proportional to the stake the nodes have designated. Other accounts that proxy their stake to a node will receive smaller payments to incentivize them to select valid nodes.\n\nMirror nodes offer a cost-effective way to query historical data without trust loss. The key network services are cryptocurrency, consensus, and token services.\n\nNetwork Fees\nClients pay fees in HBARs for the network to process a transaction. The network attempts to keep fees low. For instance, transferring HBARs between accounts costs approximately $0.0001 USD according to the team. Fees are denominated in USD but charged in HBAR. Clients are given stability in fees since the network updates the exchange rate between HBAR and USD every hour to reflect the market price.",

All members have a three-year maximum term, with up to two consecutive terms. Swirlds, the creator of the hashgraph algorithm, has a permanent seat and equal vote. After initial members are selected by Swirlds, the council’s Membership Committee will source replacements.\n\nThe Hedera network separates governance from consensus. The governance model is more traditional, using a model pioneered by National BankAmericard Inc. (now VISA) in 1968. It is designed in a way to incentivize the governing council to do what’s in the best interest of the Hedera network and discourage a single company from assuming total control. It also aims to prevent the Hedera Governing Council from being unduly influenced by individual members or node operators.\n\nThe hashgraph consensus algorithm is proprietary but “open review;” therefore, the network and its cryptocurrency cannot be forked by third-party developers, but the underlying code is available to the public for review.\n\nThe  27 current Governing Council members include:\nabrdn\nAvery Dennison\nBoeing\nChainlink Labs\nDBS\nDentons\nDeutsche Telekom\nDLA Piper\nEDF\neftpos\nFIS\nGoogle\nIBM\nIIT Madras\nLG\nLSE\nMagalu\nNomura\nServiceNow\nShinhan Bank\nStandard Bank\nSwirlds\nTata Communications\nUbisoft\nUniversity College London (UCL)\nWipro\nZain Group",

To alleviate the cash shortfall, BitFinex announced it would conduct a private offering for $1 billion for it's token Unus Sed Leo. \n\nThe token will be used to receive discounts on trading on current and future iFinex trading platforms and services. iFinex will buy back tokens from the market with a minimum of 27% of consolidated revenues from the previous month until all tokens are removed from circulation. In addition, an amount equal to 95% of the recovered net funds from Crypto Capital and 80% of recovered funds from a 2016 hack will be used to repurchase outstanding tokens. ",

MCO tokens held by Crypto.com will not be eligible for the CRO airdrop. and all unallocated CRO airdrop tokens will be used for Community development activities. 20% will be allocated to Ecosystem grants and 20% will go to a Capital Reserve.\n\nCrypto.com Chain will utilize Tendermint Core as its consensus engine. The entirety of the supply has already been issued, but 50% has been set apart to incentivize  all actors providing services to ensure integrity and successful processing of the transactions. Indeed, 30% will be reserved for Secondary Distribution. The Secondary Distribution wallet will receive a daily token supply through  a smart contract.  10% will be issued the first year, 8% the second year, 6% the third year, 4% the fourth year and 2% the fifth year. Those tokens will be distributed as network fee incentives and progressively distributed on exchanges at prevailling market price. The rewards will be distributed to the following actors: Customer acquirer nodes (60%), Merchant acquirer nodes (20%) & Council Nodes (20%). Those actors will have to stake CRO in order to receive rewards. Moreover, 20% has been set aside for the Network long-term incentives.",

Litecoin aimed to keep the best aspects of Bitcoin while making some optimizations for its use as a medium of exchange.\n\nNotably, Litecoin implements 2.5 minute block times and an 84 million max supply. Charlie Lee's original thinking was that quicker block confirmations would increase transaction throughput and reduce the amount of time merchants would need for block confirmations. Additionally, he thought the 84 million max supply would prevent the coin from becoming too scarce and expensive. Litecoin uses Scrypt, a memory intensive hashing algorithm, in order to better allow individuals to mine Litecoin with commodity hardware (although <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASICs</a> have been developed for Litecoin mining over the past few years). Finally, Charlie Lee, recognizing the mistakes of the few altcoins launched prior to Litecoin, wanted Litecoin to be launched in a fair manner, electing to only do a 150 coin (3 block) premine to allow people to get in early.\n\nCharlie Lee left Coinbase in June 2017 to head the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/litecoin-foundation\">Litecoin foundation</a>, which stewards the Litecoin project, and finances Litecoin Core development.

Each block has a 1MB limit and block rewards are <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/halving\">halved </a>every 840,000 blocks (approximately 4 years).

Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/double-spending\">double-spend</a> vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\">hash</a> less than the target number set by Litecoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Litecoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work.",

Protocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open source Litecoin community can submit Litecoin Improvement Proposals (\"LIPs\"). After debate by the community, the Litecoin Core editors, whom are supported by the Litecoin foundation, accept or reject the proposals. Decisions from the process are written into the Litecoin specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Finally, protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus. \n\nAlthough Litecoin Core and the Litecoin Foundation are separate, they work closely together on the Litecoin project with the Litecoin Foundation providing funding to Litecoin core developers.\n",

            "background_details": "Polkadot origins\nPolkadot is the brainchild of Dr. Gavin Wood, who is one of the co-founders of Ethereum and the inventor of the Solidity smart contract language. Dr. Wood started working on his idea to “design a sharded version of Ethereum” in mid-2016 and released the first draft of the Polkadot white paper in Oct. 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Wood and Parity’s Peter Czaban founded the Web3 Foundation, a non-profit entity established to support the research and development of Polkadot as well as to oversee its fundraising efforts. The Switzerland-based Web3 Foundation hosted Polkadot’s first token sale in Oct. 2017, using a Spend-All Second Price Dutch Auction to distribute the funds. The sale raised $145 million in just under two weeks, selling 50% of the initial 10 million DOT (old) supply, and the Web3 Foundation chose Parity Technologies to develop Polkadot.\n\nParity Technologies was founded by Dr. Wood and Jutta Steiner and is known for maintaining the Parity Ethereum client in addition to Substrate, which serves as the development framework for Polkadot.\n\nParity Wallet hack and subsequent fundraising efforts\nTen days after the token sale ended (Nov. 6, 2017), someone permanently froze the funds in the Parity multisig contract (the second such incident in a matter of months) compromising a little over $90 million worth of ETH equaling around 66% of Polkadot’s token sale proceeds. Polkadot, along with Parity, has petitioned the Ethereum community to consider finding a way to return to the funds, but the situation remains unresolved. Despite the lost funds, Polkadot and Web3 Foundation reported the project still had enough funds to meet its development milestones.\n\nThe Web3 Foundation reportedly raised more capital to replenish the lost funds in a 2019 private token sale. In the sale, Polkadot sought to sell 500,000 DOT (old) tokens at a $1.2 billion valuation, pricing the tokens at $120 apiece. Although the foundation did not disclose any details related to the raise, it was reported that the sale closed in June 2019 at a “successful” valuation.\n\nPolkadot technical developments and mainnet rollout\nOn the technical front, Polkadot started rolling out various proofs-of-concept (PoCs) in May 2018 to test its base relay chain, the relay chain’s support for parachains, and its finality agent (dubbed GRANDPA). PoC 3, released in Jan. 2019, also introduced the Alexander testnet, Polkadot’s first test network. But the project’s first significant release came in Aug. 2019 with the public launch of Kusama. Kusama is an early, unaudited, and unrefined release of Polkadot, designed to serve as a \"canary\" network for Polkadot to test governance, staking, and sharding under real economic conditions. Polkadot also dedicated 1% of the initial DOT supply to Kusama stakeholders in order to encourage participation.\n\nPolkadot adopted a staged rollout strategy for its mainnet launch. Polkadot's first mainnet chain candidate, Phase 1, launched on <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/polkadot-goes-live-with-the-release-of-its-first-mainnet-chain-candidate\">May 27, 2020</a>. It marked the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's mainnet launch roadmap. This early version of Polkadot operated as Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network managed by six validators belonging to the Web3 Foundation. Eventually, the network transitioned to its proposed Nominated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system on Jun. 18, 2020 (Phase 2), which enabled DOT owners to claim validators slots and unlocked staking rewards. Phases 3 and 4 in late Jul. 2020 introduced Polkadot's governance functionality and handing control of the protocol over to the community, respectively. The final phase plans to unlock DOT token transfers on Aug. 18, 2020.\n\nThe Web3 Foundation continues to use the proceeds from DOT sales to fund ecosystem initiatives and back projects building on Polkadot (see: the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/polychain-web3-foundation-start-a-fund-to-back-projects-building-on-polkadot\">Polkadot Ecosystem Fund</a>). The foundation is governed by the Foundation Council, a governing body consisting of Dr. Gavin Wood (President and Founder), Dr. Aeron Buchanan (Vice President), and Reto Trinkler.\n\nDOT redenomination\nIn the first official community vote for the network, Polkadot token holders voted to change the denomination between DOT and its smallest unit, Plancks, by a factor of 100. This change officially went into effect at block #1,248,328, which arrived on Aug. 21, 2020, about 72 hours after DOT transfers unlocked at block #1,205,128  (Aug. 18, 2020).\n\nIt was a cosmetic change that was similar to a stock split. The token balances of each Polkadot account increased by 100x, increasing the total DOT supply from its original 10 million to 1 billion. But the move did not impact Polkadot’s pre-market valuation as the dollar amount of each DOT will decrease by 100x.",

It marked the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's mainnet launch roadmap. This early version of Polkadot operates as Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network managed by six validators belonging to the Web3 Foundation. It also allows DOT investors to claims their tokens and submit their intention to act as a validator or nominator within the network's future Nominated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) design. Future launch stages will gradually introduce staking-based consensus and Polkadot's proposed on-chain governance system to lessen the influence Web3 has over the network.\n\nLearn more:\nW3F Initiates Launch: Polkadot is Live\nPolkadot CC1 Genesis: What to expect"

More importantly, it allows DOT token sale purchasers to start staking their tokens with elected validators in exchange for a portion of inflation reward payouts.\n\nEventually, Polkadot will start progressively increasing the validator set, reaching as high as 1,000 validators possibly by November."

This move gave the newly elected 13-member Council and DOT token holders the ability to propose and vote on protocol improvements or changes.

This Sudo ability allowed the Foundation to manage the chain and initiate runtime upgrades during Polkadot's early phases, such as when the network converted to its Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) protocol. With the removal of these admin keys, Polkadot has now transitioned from a candidate chain to its official mainnet and no longer operates similarly to a permissioned network.\n\nThe network's future direction is now in the hands of its on-chain governance system, a three-chamber model consisting of a Council, a Technical Committee, and DOT token holders.

DOT holders are also responsible for managing significant events by voting on protocol upgrades and fixes. The token also ensures that network participants act in a manner that does not damage the network by giving them skin in the game. In order to create new parachains, tokens must be bonded ensuring incentive alignment.\n\nHow to stake DOTs\nWhile validators on Polkadot need to maintain the (often expensive) hardware necessary to secure the network, anyone can assume the role of a nominator by bonding their DOTs to a dedicated validator. Bonding tokens helps increase the network’s cost of attack and allows DOT holders to earn newly minted tokens as staking rewards. Polkadot is targeting about a 75% stake rate, which at a 10% inflation rate in the network’s inaugural year, would provide an annual staking return of~20%. Bonded tokens will remain locked for twelve weeks and are subject to slashing (loss of funds) should the chosen validator go offline or misbehave.\n\nPolkadot Wallet\nThere are multiple teams working on Polkadot wallet implementations prior to network launch. Most notably, blockchain.com announced that it will integrate DOT tokens into its wallet allowing users to store, send and receive tokens as well as participate in governance by voting on proposals."

The sale was split between a private sale, which raised over $80 million, and a public sale, which raised the remainder. Participants were required to use a KYC system called PICOPS, which verifies the identity of each participant. Participants that were unable to verify themselves were deemed ineligible. The sale was also not available to any Chinese or American citizens due to regulatory concerns. \n\nAt the start of the network, a total of 10 million DOT (old) will be created as a native token. The initial supply was later redenominated by a community vote, a cosmetic change that increased token account balances by 100x. The following allocations are the same for both DOT (old) and new DOT:\n\n50% allocated to token sale investors\n5% allocated to the 2019 private sale investors\n3.4% allocated to 2020 token sale investors\n11.6% retained by the Foundation for future fundraising efforts\n30% allocated to the Web 3 Foundation for immediate use to develop the Polkadot network and other undisclosed Foundation activities.\n\nThe total supply is not fixed at 1 billion but instead will use a to be determined inflationary model to supply the rewards for the proof-of-stake (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\">PoS</a>) system. \n\nOn Nov. 6, 2017, a vulnerability was exploited in the Parity multi-sig wallet containing over 500,000 ETH, including $98 million of the $140 million+ in ETH raised through the Polkadot ICO. These funds are currently frozen, and a debate among the Ethereum community will determine whether these funds can or will ever be recovered. Even if the funds are lost, the Parity team does not believe this will impact their development roadmap.\n\nIn Jun. 2019, The Web3 Foundation announced it sold another 500,000 DOT (old) tokens (now 50 million new DOT) to an undisclosed group of private investors. Based on previous reports from Polkadot, the project was seeking to raise $60 million at a $1.2 billion valuation through this token sale. The Jun. 2019 announcement declared the raise successful, implying the Polkadot reached its target."

              "consensus_details": "Polkadot uses what it calls a hybrid consensus, which separates finality from the block production mechanism. At a high level, Polkadot allows the network to produce blocks at a rapid pace while permitting the slower finality agent to run in a separate process, thereby not affecting transaction execution times. This design theoretically helps overcome the issues associated with probabilistic finality, namely the chance of unknowingly following an incorrect fork or the inability to produce new blocks (aka stalling).\n\nThe two mechanisms that power Polkadot’s consensus include:\nBABE: The Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is the block production mechanism. It assigns block production slots to randomly selected validators according to stake (as defined by the Polkadot randomness cycle).\nGRANDPA: The GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA) is the finality gadget for the Polkadot relay chain. This agent reaches agreements on chains rather than blocks, which could speed up the finalization process. Polkadot helps elaborate on this definition by stating if “more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.”\n\nWhile the core technology of Polkadot is the relay chain, the network reaches consensus through a modified and proprietary PoS mechanism consisting of four key participants: collators, validators, nominators, and fishermen.\n\nCollator\nEach parachain has a collator that fulfills the task of a miner in a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-work\">proof-of-work</a> (PoW) blockchain. A collator must maintain the Polkadot relay chain state as well as the state of the parachain. The collator then manages the queue of transactions going into and out of the parachain from the relay chain. Collators collect parachain transactions, produce state transition proofs, create new candidate blocks and then pass them along to validators in exchange for a fee for their work. In a competitive market with many collators, collators can incentivize validators to choose their block by sharing a portion of their fee with the validator.\n\nValidators\nValidators are randomly nominated to accept block candidates from parachain collators, verify the information in the block, and republish the block candidate to the Polkadot relay chain. Once a validator confirms a block, they also validate and change the state of the relay chain block by moving the transaction data from the originating parachain’s input queue to the destination parachain’s output queue. Validators are incentivized through a staking mechanism that requires them to stake Polkadot (DOT) tokens to the network to be chosen as an active validator. Validators that break the consensus algorithm are punished by losing a portion of their stake, while those that correctly secure the network and verify blocks are rewarded with new tokens.\n\nNominators\nNominators are those who may be unable to participate in the transaction validation process directly, so they instead contribute tokens to a validator of their choice. Nominators receive a pro-rata share of the validator reward based on their portion of the validator’s bond, so nominators are incentivized to choose a validator most likely to receive the largest reward. The team believes the nominator process will create a competitive, but honest, marketplace for high-quality validators and nominators.\n\nFishermen\nFishermen do not participate in the transaction validation process with validators and nominators, but instead, act as watchmen monitoring activity across the Polkadot network and identify validators who break consensus rules. Fishermen stake a smaller bond of tokens than a validator but receive a proportionally larger reward than validators for their role in securing the network.",

            "technology_details": "Polkadot features a variety of technical components, including the relay-chain, parachains, the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE), and cross-network bridges.\n\nRelay-chain\nPolkadot's relay-chain is built with Substrate, a blockchain building framework that is the distillation of Parity technologies learnings building Ethereum, Bitcoin, and enterprise blockchains. It is at the core of the network, helping map addresses to account information, coordinating communications, and providing consensus through a pooled security mechanism utilizing proof-of-stake (PoS). All validators stake their DOTs and produced blocks directly on the relay-chain.\n\nThe relay chain lacks features like smart contracts and instead is designed to be a minimal protocol to connect other network participants and provide transaction finality. Since this central chain is handling the bulk of the network’s transaction flows, actions on the relay-chain may come at a premium. But the relay-chain will delegate a significant portion of the computational work to the surrounding parachains, which can have “differing implementations and features.”\n\nParachains\nParachains will be used to collect and process transactions while using the relay chain for finality. To increase transaction throughput, parachains will process transactions concurrently across multiple chains, instead of queuing transactions and processing them sequentially.\n\nPolkadot does not place any constraints on the design and structure of parachains. These network components can be application-specific or support a particular feature (e.g., privacy or scalability). But each parachain must generate a proof regularly so a designated Polkadot validator can verify and reconcile past transactions. Parachains also share the same state as the relay-chain, meaning if the relay-chain should revert at any point, then all parachains would revert as well. In terms of composability, cross-parachain communication is native to Polkadot. Therefore, parachains will be able to send messages (including transactions and data) to each other “without the need for smart contracts to perform the bridging functionality.”\n\nPolkadot Runtime Environment (PRE)\nThe PRE consists of the networking, consensus and WebAssembly Virtual Machine subsystems. Polkadot breaks the components of the PRE down to:\nNetwork Interactions\nState storage and the Storage Trie\nConsensus Engine\nWasm Virtual Machine (VM)\n\nPolkadot’s state machine is compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), a high-performance virtual environment. WASM is developed by major companies including Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, that have created a large ecosystem of support for the standard. Polkadot's networking uses libp2p, a cross-platform network framework for peer-to-peer applications that handles the peer discovery and communication in the Polkadot ecosystem. The Polkadot runtime environment is being coded in C++, and Golang to make Polkadot accessible to a wider range of developers.\n\nBridging\nPolkadot will eventually enable the connections to outside networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin through a series of specialized bridge contracts or modules. There are two different types of external bridging in Polkadot:\nBridge contracts: Smart contracts that connect Polkadot’s relay-chain to external chains (for example, the Parity Bridge between an Ethereum Proof-of-Authority (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-authority\">PoA</a>) sidechain to a Substrate-based chain)\nIn-built bridging modules: Purpose-built modules that help external chains connect with Polkadot",

This governance system remained intact through Polkadot's mainnet launch and early existence. In late Jul. 2020, control over the protocol was transferred to the network's proposed on-chain governance system, which takes into consideration token holders, validators, a Council, and a Technical Committee. These network participants are now the primary source of upgrade submissions and approvals. Parity and Web3 can still develop and submit proposals of their own, but they must pass through the governance system before being implemented.",

            "onchain_governance_type": "Delegated On-Chain Vote",
            "onchain_governance_details": "Polkadot’s future on-chain governance system that hands the future direction of the protocol over to a technical council, an on-chain entity consisting of members voted in by network stakeholders. This system will allow active token holders and Council members to propose codebase changes by bonding a minimum amount of DOTs to the network to ensure some economic buy-in. Other token holders can also deposit an equivalent amount of tokens to the proposal to support it. The top proposals by stake amount are selected to be a referendum, which Polkadot defines as “inclusive, stake-based voting schemes.” Bonded tokens are returned once the proposal is brought to a vote. If the proposal originates within the Council, Council members can approve the raw submission internally and move the proposal to a referendum.\n\nEvery 30 days, a new referendum is brought to a vote, with separate queues for Council and public submissions. To vote, token holders must lock up their tokens “for at least the enactment delay period,” which could stretch beyond the end of the referendum, to ensure economic buy-in and discourage vote selling.\n\nWhat determines if the proposal passes the vote depends on which entity proposed the referendum. Polkadot references [three possible scenarios](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#tallying):\n- If a public submission, Positive Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Approve)\n- If a Council submission that reaches a “Complete agreement,” Negative Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Against)\n- If a Council submission that reaches a “Majority agreement,” Simple Majority\n\nAt genesis, the [Council](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#council) began with thirteen members, represented as on-chain accounts. There are plans to increase this total over the following nine months to a max of 24. DOT holders vote these representatives into their privileged positions via a network-wide election process. All members have a fixed term of one year, although any representative can be removed early via a referendum. Network participants rely on the Council for two primary tasks: proposing new referenda and canceling possibly malicious proposals. Members must reach a unanimous agreement to carry out a referendum cancellation.\n\nPolkadot also employs a [Technical Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#technical-committee), first introduced in the Kusama rollout, as one of the three chambers of its governance system. Committee representatives consist of teams that previously “implemented or specified either Polkadot/Kusama runtime or the runtime environment.” The Council has the power to either add or remove Technical Committee teams by a simple majority vote. The committee’s sole purpose is to produce emergency referenda in the event of a dire situation. These proposals get fast-tracked for Council voting and implementation.\n\nThis governance design is in practice at the moment on the Kusama network. Its upgrade to CC3 on Nov. 28, 2019, unlocked its on-chain governance capabilities, enabling stakeholders to submit and vote on potential code changes. Through this process, Kusama participants already increased the network validator count beyond its base level and unlocked KSM token transfers.\n\nSee Kusama referenda [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/democracy) and the list of Kusama Council members [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/council).",

A year later Hayden Adams began working on turning this idea into a functional product. After receiving several grants as well as $100,000 from the Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap launch in November 2018. The protocol quickly gained liquidity and started facilitating meaningful volume. Six months after launching, a fundraising round was <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/paradigm-backs-decentralized-exchange-protocol-uniswap\">completed</a>, led by Paradigm to allow the addition of two more employees.\n\nWhat makes Uniswap unique is that it solves the problem of high spreads for illiquid assets on order-book exchanges. This problem exists because there is little incentive for professional market makers to provide liquidity on very thinly traded assets. However, with Uniswap, anyone can be a market maker by depositing assets into a pool and earning fees based on the amount of trading activity. One downside to this model is that there is substantial slippage for large orders as the price paid increases as the quantity demanded increases.",

            "technology_details": "Uniswap is a protocol that facilitates the exchange of tokens on Ethereum. Unlike most other DEXs, there is no native token and every action occurs on-chain. Typically, exchanges function by using an order-book where market makers set the price at which they are willing to buy and sell an asset. The difference between these prices is how they get paid for this work. Uniswap does away entirely with the order book and instead opts to have market makers deposit assets into a pool that traders can then trade against. The price is determined algorithmically based on the proportion of the two assets being traded.\n\nPrice mechanism\nUniswap uses what's known as a Constant Product Market Maker that is designed to always provide liquidity regardless of the order size or amount of funds in the pool. This is achieved by asymptotically increasing the price as the size of the buy order increases, leading to potentially significant slippage on large orders. Trading pools consist of an ERC-20 token and an equivalent amount of ETH, with the product between the two sums remaining constant. Any given transaction increases one sum while decreasing the other and the price changes based on the ratio between the two. Users can also swap between two ERC-20 tokens, however, Uniswap will perform two separate actions with each of their respective pools.\n\nProviding liquidity\nWhen liquidity providers add to a pool, they receive newly minted liquidity tokens entitling them to their proportion of the total pool as well as the 0.3% fee generated off each trade. These tokens are not speculative and simply keep track of how much of the pool is owed. Liquidity providers need to supply both assets in the same proportion they are currently at, otherwise, they will change the ratio and thus price. This would result in the immediate loss of money as the price change should get arbitraged out by trading bots. Even if providers supply the correct ratio of each asset, large price changes can result in the loss of money. (Details on how this work can be found here). Therefore, providers are hoping for substantial volume of trading around the price they entered such that the fees generated account for any potential losses.",

            "background_details": "Monero traces its origins back to <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bytecoin/profile\">Bytecoin</a>, the first implementation of CryptoNote, which was an application layer protocol aimed at solving various issues with Bitcoin such as traceability, mining centralization, and irregular coin emission. Bytecoin launched in March 2014; however, after a controversial 80% premine, a Bitcointalk forum user known as thankfulfortoday forked the codebase of Bytecoin into the a new project named BitMonero, a compound of Bit (as in Bitcoin) and Monero (meaning \"coin\" in Esperanto). \n\nThe release of BitMonero was poorly received by the community that initially backed it, leading seven community members to fork BitMonero into a new project called Monero. This largely pseudonymous group, led by Fluffypony (<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/riccardo-spagni\">Riccardo Spagni</a>), ultimately became the first Monero Core team. Monero launched its project in April 2014 with no premine. \n\nMonero's payment anonymity has garnered significant attention from a panoply of crypto-curious persons. Since its launch Monero has become one of the most widely used darknet currencies in the world due to its anonymity by default features. In 2017 Monero further enhanced its privacy features by incorporating Ring CT signatures, a solution proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, that obscures transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. This provided near complete transaction anonymity in contrast to just sender anonymity as it was previously. In October 2018, Monero implemented bulletproofs, a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\">zero-knowledge proof</a> technology that replaced the previous zero-knowledge range proofs that its confidential transactions relied on. Bulletproofs cut the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent, significantly increasing transaction efficiency. \n\nMonero undergoes scheduled hard forks every six months intended to allow Monero to evolve at a regular cadence, while still leaving users enough time to update before being forked away from the network. These hard forks tend to include everything from patches and bug fixes to hashing algorithm changes and functionality upgrades.\n\nIn December 2019, Fluffypony (Riccardo Spagni), Monero's lead maintainer <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/monero-s-fluffypony-steps-down\">stepped down</a> from the project in an effort to further decentralize the project.

Consensus in Monero, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.\n\nMining\nMiners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the RandomX proof-of-work algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\">hash</a> less than the target number set by Monero's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every block.\n\nIn the pursuit of decentralization at the miner level, Monero periodically changes its proof-of-work algorithm via hard forks to ensure Monero remains ASIC resistant and open to individuals with commodity hardware. Like many proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block. This is to smooth individuals' mining revenue as mining has become more competitive. \n\nBlock sizes in Monero are dynamic and there is no preset block size limit like there is in Bitcoin. However, despite there being no block size limits, Monero has a block reward penalty system that keeps block sizes in check. The block reward penalty system works first by taking the median size of the last 100 blocks. If a new block's size is greater than that median, then the block reward gets reduced quadratically depending on how much the new block size exceeds that median. The maximum block size is set at two times the median of the last 100 blocks, and as the block size approaches that limit the block reward approaches zero. ",

            "technology_details": "Monero, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/utxo\">unspent transaction output </a>(UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of dynamic-sized data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/mempool\">mempool</a>) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Monero's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Monero uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. \n\nMonero runs a proof-of-work algorithm called RandomX, an algorithm using random code execution and memory-hard techniques for ASIC resistance. Monero initiates hard forks every 6 months to implement upgrades to the protocol, often times changing its PoW algorithm to prevent ASICs from joining the network.\n\nMonero's privacy enhancements stem from ring signatures, which mask sender identities and offers single-use keys to make transactions untraceable. Ring signatures merge a group of signers together to better preserve the anonymity of the true signer. The group is comprised of the actual signers single use key initiating the transaction and past transaction outputs from Monero’s blockchain. Including past transaction outputs helps preserve the senders anonymity because they are theoretically indistinguishable to an outside observer as the valid transaction itself. \n\nIn January 2017, Monero implemented Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CTs) in an effort to combat concerns around the true degree of anonymity offered by Monero. Ring signatures only provided privacy for the sender of the transaction, and required outputs to be broken up into separate rings because ring signatures could only contain outputs of the same value. Ring CT signatures aimed to alleviate these concerns by obscuring transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. With Ring CTs wallets could arbitrarily select ring members from any output size. To prove that certain amounts were spent, Ring CTs used range proofs, a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\">zero knowledge cryptography</a> technique used to prove the amount used in a transaction with revealing the details. \n\nHowever, the range proofs used in Monero's confidential transactions to ensure the integrity of transactions, were computationally intensive, leading the Monero blockchain to bloat due to the onerous data requirements of each transaction. Thus, in October 2018 Monero implemented bulletproofs, which addressed this scalability issue, cutting the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent and significantly increasing transaction efficiency. Bulletproofs are a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof that does not require a trusted setup. Bulletproofs aggregate information into new data structures that scale logarithmically, rather than linearly, allowing even greater scaling for larger transactions that contain multiple outputs.",

Once new code has been implemented into the Monero Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nMonero funds protocol development through its Forum Funding System (FFS), a donation based crowdfunding system. The FFS is a system whereby anyone can propose ideas and request anonymous donations to fund development work. Once proposals have been funded, funds are released as certain milestones are reached.    \n\nMonero opts for scheduled hard forks every six months. The community believes that not only does this ensure the protocol is continuously being improved at a regular cadence, but it also keeps the community engaged in the governance process. ",

            "technology_details": "Aave’s shifted from a decentralized P2P lending strategy (direct loan relationship between lenders and borrowers, like in ETHLend) to a pool-based strategy. Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead, they rely on the pooled funds, as well as the amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the pool.\n\nFlash Loans\nAave also allows loans to be taken out without any collateral by creating logic that if it's not repaid within the block time, the transaction gets reversed. These flash loans are designed to be used by developers to build tools that require capital for arbitrage, refinancing or liquidating purposes. An example would be if a user took out a loan on <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\">Maker</a> and the collateral price dropped making it close to liquidation, they could use a flash loan to repay the Maker loan and receive their collateral back. They could then sell the collateral to repay the flash loan thus avoiding the liquidation penalty on Maker without ever needing to actually have the funds necessary for repayment.\n\nRate Switching\nAnother unique feature of Aave is that it allows borrowers to switch between fixed and floating interest rates. Interest rates in DeFi are traditionally volatile making it difficult to estimate the long-term cost of borrowing. If a user anticipates interest rates to rise they can switch their loan to fixed rate in order to lock in their borrowing costs for the future, and if they expect rates to decrease they can switch back to floating to then decrease their borrowing costs. There are two exceptions where the fixed rate can actually change and that is if the deposit earning rate increases above the fixed borrow rate because the system could get unstable by paying out more than its being paid. In that case, the fixed rate is rebalanced to the new stable rate. the other scenario which works in the borrower's favor is if the variable rate is lower than the fixed rate by 20%, the loan will automatically decrease to account for the difference. \n",

            "background_details": "The DAO hack gives rise to Ethereum Classic\nThe DAO hack and resulting <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\">hard fork</a> split the Ethereum network into two separate chains: <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The DAO was an Ethereum-based venture fund that managed to raise ~$150 million in Ether in an April 2016 <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\">initial coin offering (ICO)</a>.  A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the hacker to steal 3.6 million ETH of the funds collected in its ICO.\n\nA divide in the community formed around how to resolve the issue. One camp believed reverting the chain, thus erasing the hack from the network's history, was necessary to preserve the longevity of Ethereum. The other side reasoned mutability was antithetical to the ethos of crypto networks and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide led to a contentious hard fork at block 1,920,001, and the legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history rebranded to Ethereum Classic.\n\nBefore the DAO fork split the original Ethereum chain, there was just one group of users, service providers, developers, investors, and other network participants. The hard fork or \"irregular state change\" split not only the protocol layer but also the social and application layers. As the legacy chain, Ethereum Classic inherited the components outlined within the Ethereum whitepaper. At the time of the fork, Ethereum Classic was still identical to Ethereum regarding these original components. However, it soon began to diverge away from Ethereum by announcing its own roadmap and vision.\n\nPhilosophy and monetary policy change\nThe Ethereum Classic (ETC) community stresses the core principals of censorship resistance and (most prominently) immutability. And as a continuation of the Ethereum blockchain, it features a Turing-complete <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contract</a> language to support the development of more complex <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>. The Ethereum Classic community governs the network by the motto \"Code is Law,\" which instills the belief that ETC transactions and dApps are truly censorship-resistant and immune to any third party interference.\n\nETC later (March 2017) adopted a new, Bitcoin-like monetary policy fit with a fixed supply cap and disinflationary emission schedule. The proposal drastically deviated from the original Ethereum monetary policy, which remains in flux as Ethereum core devs look to establish a more concrete economic model for its future <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\">Proof of Stake (PoS)</a> network. Instead of monetary flexibility (and some uncertainty), Ethereum Classic now features a max supply of 210,700,000 tokens and miner reward reductions every five million blocks. And unlike Ethereum, the community intends to stick with <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof of Work (PoW)</a> as its consensus and token issuance mechanism.  \n\nDevelopment teams and future developments\nETC's structure varies from most blockchain projects, incorporating multiple development teams (IOHK, ETC Labs, and ETC Cooperative), each with their own goals. In general, most of these teams have focused on providing sidechain <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/scaling\">scaling</a> solutions, improving development tools (SDKs), and promoting cross-chain transactions so others can build on Ethereum Classic. Some of these efforts, including Connext's state channels and ChainSafe's bridge to Ethereum and Cosmos SDK-based chains, have already launched.\n\nETC is one of the few cryptocurrencies where investors can gain exposure to it through a traditional brokerage and or retirement account. Grayscale Investments created an Ethereum Classic Investment Trust (ticker ETCG) that allows investors to gain exposure to ETC without having to store or secure it directly.\n\n51% attacks\nAs a minority chain using the Ethash mining algorithm, Ethereum Classic has been the target of multiple 51% attacks. The first attack occurred in Jan. 2019, when crypto exchange Coinbase <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/updated-ethereum-classic-has-experienced-multiple-100-reorg-attack-ethereum-classic-claims-not-an-attack-new-miners-being-tested-coinbase-rebuts\">detected</a> a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. The number of identified reorganizations eventually increased to a total of fifteen, twelve of which contained double spends, totaling 219,500 ETC (~$1.1 million).\n\nIn Aug. 2020, Ethereum Classic suffered three more 51% attacks. The first one resulted in a successful double-spend of 807,260 ETC (~$5.6 million at the time). The second attack occurred less than a week later and exhibited a similar reorg depth (about 4,000 blocks). The final Aug. 2020 attack resulted in a large reorg of 7,000 blocks, but there is no sign of a double-spend attempt as of yet. As for a possible solution, the ETC Cooperative would like to switch Ethereum Classic's hashing algorithm from Ethash to either Keccak-256 or SHA-3, which would mean Ethereum Classic would no longer be a minority chain and would potentially be less susceptible to similar attacks.",

The sale took place between Jul. 22, 2014, and Sep. 2, 2014. The remaining 12 million ETH (20% of the initial supply) were allocated to the Foundation and early contributors. Of the ether sent to the Foundation:\n3 million were allocated to a long-term endowment\n6 million were distributed among 85 developers who contributed prior to the crowdsale\n3 million were designed as a “developer purchase program” that gave Ethereum developers the rights to purchase ETC at crowdsale prices.\n\nAll other ETH (and now ETC) issuance that took place occurred through the process of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining.\n\nThe Fork Distribution\nWhen Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split following the DAO fork (on July 20, 2016), anyone who held ETH now owned equivalent amounts of ETH and ETC. When a contentious hard fork occurs, users of the original chain can claim the native asset issued on the new chain, if different. Since the Ethereum Foundation trademarked the name \"Ethereum\" and the \"ETH\" ticker, the legacy chain opted to rebrand itself to \"Ethereum Classic\" and use the ticker \"ETC\" for its native asset."

Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/mining\">mining</a> pool could obtain a majority of the <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\">hash power</a> on a given chain.\n\nThe GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/orphan-block\">orphan blocks</a> in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain byweighingthe parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.\n\nMining\nEthereum Classic miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash as defined by the network's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\">difficulty adjustment</a> algorithm. Ethereum Classic recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.\n\nCryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. Since Ethereum and Ethereum Classic share the same mining algorithm at the moment, ASIC miners on Ethereum can shift their hash power over to Ethereum Classic to mine ETC. This opportunity combined with lower security spend on Ethereum Classic likely led to the various <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/51-attack\">51% attacks</a> registered on Ethereum Classic, the first of which occurred in Jan. 2019 followed by three more in Aug. 2020.\n\nLearn more:\nEthereum Classic Node Documentation\nETC Nodes (Ethereum Classic Node Tracker",

            "technology_details": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) kept most of the original Ethereum technical features and architecture. It remains an account-based blockchain (as opposed to Bitcoin's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/utxo\">UTXO</a> model) consisting of external accounts, which are controlled by a user’s private keys, and contract accounts, which are managed by contract code. External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contracts</a> and enable the programmability of <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>.\n\nEthereum Classic also continues to use the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine\">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>, the smart contract execution engine. It is a Turing-complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity or others such as the Python-based Vyper. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum Classic node operators and miners provide these resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas.\n\nThe fee to make transactions or execute smart contract operations on ETC is (gas price) * (gas limit), and fees are paid to miners for including your transactions in a block. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas users are willing to spend on a transaction, whereas the gas price is the cost users are willing to pay for each gas unit. A normal transaction on the network costs 21,000 gas but costs more if you are trying to execute something more complex as that requires more computational power. Users can also speed up their transactions by raising the gas price since that will incentivize miners to include the transaction(s) in the next block to receive those fees.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) uses Ethash as its <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. New blocks are generated every 15 seconds, on average, and the current miner reward for each new block found is 3.2 ETC which is reduced by 20% every 5 million blocks (about 2.4 years). ETC will be mineable until around 2070 when miners will reach the soft supply cap of between 210 million and 230 million. In addition to miner rewards, ETC rewards miners for discovering “uncle blocks”. Uncle blocks are valid blocks that arrived too late, meaning another miner already solved the PoW and claimed that block height's reward. This practice aims to decrease mining centralization, reduce the chance of unintentional forks, and boost network security. Every new block can contain at most two uncle blocks. Uncle block rewards are 3.125% of the miners' reward or 0.125 ETC.",

          "governance_details": "All network changes are subject to the improvement proposal or ECIP process, which is a standardized model for proposing changes to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. In this model, anyone can submit code changes, dubbed Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIP), that aim to either modify the core protocol or even the ECIP process itself. The ECIP process takes after the EIP and BIP systems used in Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively.\n\nOnce the author submits a proposal, they must champion it to be successful, which consists of the author making themselves available to answer any questions from network stakeholders. Proposals must also pass through several stages before being implemented into node client software.\n\nProposals begin in the “Draft Stage,” and if successful, make their way to the “Accepted Stage.” Submissions must pass each stage by a rough consensus. Client developers may add the submitted changes to their clients at their discretion. There are no on-chain voting mechanisms Ethereum Classic relies on to make changes.\n\nLearn more:\nECIP Repository\nECIP Directory\nECIP 'Issues Section'\nDiscord ECIP Channel",

NEAR has also been designed to be developer and user-friendly as it features a few key innovations to accelerate the application development and user-onboarding processes. The NEAR blockchain was created and developed by the NEAR Foundation. Its mainnet went live in April 2020, and network validators voted to unlock token transfers in October 2020. NEAR's bridge to Ethereum (called the Rainbow Bridge) launched in March 2021.",

Illia Polosukhin and Alexander Skidanov started NEAR.ai in early 2017 to explore program synthesis: the field of automating programs from a human specification. Named for the science fiction novel The Singularity Is Near, the NEAR project drew from Illia’s work as a lead contributor for TensorFlow at Google and Alexander’s as the lead engineer at MemSQL. \n\nResearching program synthesis led the team to explore programmable smart contract platforms and crypto payments in late 2017 and early 2018. As they explored the solution space and tried out a variety of blockchain protocols, they realized the current state of the tech didn’t meet their needs and began to design a blockchain that could. Illia and Alex gathered a team of engineers and formally started building NEAR Protocol in August 2018.  The founding vision for the NEAR platform was to offer developers an easy path to building decentralized applications that can scale to mass usage. To achieve these goals, NEAR adopted a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to support transaction verification and block production. \n\nNEAR combines a horizontal scaling approach with a new consensus mechanism that splits the network into parallel shards and dynamically distributes the computation to increase the network's processing capacity. The network launched in April 2020, became community-operated in September 2020, and passed a vote to enable token transfers in October 2020.",

The network charges transaction fees for processing the changes to this stored data. The NEAR network collects and automatically burns these fees, such that higher usage will lead to more NEAR tokens being burned. A minimum percentage of smart contract usage fees is allocated for developer rewards. This reward effectively incentivizes early application development that increase network use. When a contract is called, some portion of the transaction fees is generated by the network is automatically allocated to the contract.

Near also burns 70% of all transaction fees; therefore, real inflation (rewards - fees burned) could be less than 5% depending on the level of network activity.

The list of all the transactions in each block is split into physical chunks, one chunk per shard. All chunks accumulate to one block. Note that chunks can only be validated by nodes that maintain the state of that shard. \n\nTheoretically, each logical block contains all the transactions for all the shards. However, since transmitting a logical block across the network would be prohibitively expensive, it is never initiated. Instead, each network participant maintains the state that corresponds to the shards that they validate transactions for and any additional shard that they want to track. \n\nThe consensus is based on the heaviest chain consensus. Meaning, once a block producer publishes a block, they collect the signatures of validator nodes. The weight of a block is then the cumulative stake of all the signers whose signatures are included in the block. The weight of a chain is the sum of the block weights. Additionally, the consensus utilises a finality gadget that introduces additional slashing conditions for higher chain security. \n\nResources:\nNightshade Whitepaper\nHow to run a node",

          "overview": {
            "technology_details": "  NEAR’s blockchain uses a new consensus algorithm and a sharding architecture to achieve a relatively high level of performance. The key elements of NEAR’s technology are:\nDynamic Re-Sharding\nNightshade\nDoomslug\nFees as Developer Rewards\nToken Balance-Based Storage\n\nDynamic Re-Sharding\nThere are two ways to approach scalability - Horizontal and Vertical. NEAR has chosen to use sharding, which is a type of horizontal scaling technique. Sharding is an approach to scaling databases, and it involves spreading computing and storage capacity across multiple servers. In the world of blockchains, sharding involves partitioning a blockchain across subgroups of nodes and distributes computation across multiple parallelized sub-chains (\"shards\"). Sharding is not live on NEAR at the moment.\n\nOnce sharding goes live on NEAR, the network intends to regularly adjust the number of shards supported by the network based on user demand. The project calls this demand-based approach to scaling \"Dynamic re-sharding.\" This scheme allows the network to only pay for the infrastructure and scale it needs at any given time. Dynamic re-sharding might be a more cost-efficient approach to scaling and securing a sharded network since node storage requirements can adjust with demand.\n\nNightshade\nNEAR uses a new sharding approach called Nightshade to reach consensus and settle cross-shard transactions. Most sharded networks use a smaller validator committee that rotates its lead block proposer when validating transactions across shards. This approach introduces some difficulties to the validation process. For instance, these validator groups must either download the entire state of each shard or receive only the portion that changed. The validation process for either technique can be inefficient as the first one requires a bigger time frame and the second one requires a larger state size.\n\nNightshade offers a different model by modifying the typical sharding abstraction. It assumes that each shard works together to produce \"chunks\" of data that collectively create a single block. Blocks are produced with a regular cadence regardless of whether each individual shard has produced its “chunk” for that specific block height. Nightshade is a leader-based system, meaning it assigns a single validator to produce each block. This validator must assemble the data chunks generated by each shard during their leadership period into a block. Leadership assignments will rotate through the existing validator set. Validators don't accept transactions, only chunks.\n\nDoomslug\nDoomslug is NEAR Protocol's new block production technique. According to the team, it enables the network to achieve some sense of practical finality after one round of communication, with a finality gadget providing BFT finality after a secondround.  Practical finality in Doomslug (or Doomslug finality) is when a block is irreversible unless at least one participant is slashed. Doomslug also allows the network to continue producing and finalizing blocks as long as over half of the validator set are online and honest, although the finality gadget will stall if less than two-thirds of participants are online.\n\nFees as Developer Rewards\nNEAR distributes 30% of any transaction fee to the contract (or contracts) that transaction calls. The contract’s owner (often a developer group or a DAO) can decide how to allocate these funds. These fee “rewards'' effectively incentivize early application development on NEAR. The percentage of fees allocated to this reward is a system-level parameter (can be adjusted by governance), but developers may choose to receive any amount equal to or above this minimum value.\n\nToken-Based Storage\nNEAR token holders have the right to store data on the chain. For example, if someone holds a balance of 1 NEAR, it means that the person can store nearly 10 KB of data on the account. This model is similar to how checking accounts in banks require a minimum balance to have an account. It allows contracts that are maintaining important state to pay validators proportionally to the amount of data they are securing.\n",

DFINITY’s vision is for its new internet infrastructure to support a wide variety of end-user and enterprise applications, such as social media, messaging, and data storage.\n\nThe project was founded as DFINITY in October 2016 by Dominic Williams. DFINITY raised a total of $121 million from contributors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, SV Angel, Aspect Ventures, Electric Capital, ZeroEx, Scalar Capital, and Multicoin Capital. In 2018, the DFINITY Foundation distributed ICP tokens to 50,000+ registered participants through an airdrop.\n\nOn December 18, 2020, DFINITY launched the alpha mainnet of the Internet Computer. The team then launched the Internet Computer into the public domain on May 10, 2021. Its public launch also marked the release of the Internet Computer’s source code and the ICP utility token's transaction and governance functionalities.",

The Network Nervous System (NNS) governance mechanism converts ICP to cycles at a variable rate. This rate is chosen to ensure users of the network can always create new cycles at an approximately constant cost in real terms, such that the cost of acquiring fuel is predictable. \nParticipant Rewards: The network mints new ICP to reward and incentivize those contributing to the network and enabling it to function. These contributions include (1) the provision of “voting rewards” to those participating in governance, (2) the provision of “compute rewards” to those operating the node machines hosting the network, and (3) other miscellaneous activities."

The sale distributed 24.72% of the total ICP supply. A year later (February 2018), DFINITY opted to raise a private strategic round, securing $20.5 million in a round led by a16z (the crypto asset investment arm of Andreessen Horowitz) and Polychain Capital.\n\nA few months later, DFINITY airdropped $35 million worth of ICP (then called DFN) tokens to interested users - although the giveaway was only available to non-United States residents.\n\nDFINITY secured a second private fundraise of $97 in August 2018 led once again by a16z and Polychain Capital.",

            "technology_details": "The purpose of the Internet Computer (IC) is to extend the public internet. The current internet is a network that connects everybody and everything, but systems and services run on infrastructure managed by private companies. \n\nThe IC aims to upend this model through the creation of Chain Key Technology, which includes several complementary components like a new consensus model (Threshold Relay), Non-Interactive Distributed Key Generation (NI-DKG), an on-chain governance system (the Network Nervous System or NNS), and decentralized identity (Internet Identity).\n\nChain Key Technology consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that orchestrate the nodes that make up the Internet Computer. It enables the IC to have a single public key, which is small enough (in size) to allow any device, like smartwatches and mobile phones, to verify the authenticity of artifacts from the Internet Computer.\n\nChain Key Technology is the engine that drives the Internet Computer and makes its operation possible. It allows for:\nAdding new nodes to form new subnets to help scale the network\nReplacing faulty or crashed nodes with new ones without stopping\nReviving subnets even if too many nodes within have failed\nUpgrading the Internet Computer Protocol, allowing the network to fix bugs and add new features\n\nThe DFINITY R&D team has also invented a new noninteractive key resharing protocol. Each of the old signers only needs to broadcast a single message to the new signers. To ensure that this is done securely, many concepts from advanced cryptography are utilized, including encryption with forward secrecy and noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs. Because it is noninteractive, the way the key resharing protocol operates is ideal for an asynchronous environment, and the benefits include key preservation. Throughout the lifetime of a subnet, it is known by a single public key, and the other parties on the Internet Computer do not have to keep track of changing public keys.",

The NNS can perform tasks such as upgrading node machines to update the protocol or apply security fixes, tweaking economic parameters, or forming new subnet blockchains to increase network capacity. It runs within the Internet Computer’s protocols and is able to make these changes without interrupting the network’s operation.\n\nThe NNS works by allowing users to stake ICP governance tokens to create voting neurons. Anyone can create a neuron. Users must give neurons a notice of withdrawal that determines their exploration period when creating them, where the length of the notice period is a configuration known as the “dissolve delay.” The voting power of neurons, and their relative claim to voting rewards, is proportional to the quantity of staked ICP, the length of the configured dissolve delay, and their “age.” Neurons can be made to vote manually, or automatically, by following other neurons in a form of liquid democracy.\n\nNeuron holders are placed in a crypto-economic game, where they are incentivized to vote to adopt/reject proposals or configure neuron follows that lead them to vote automatically in a desirable way, according to what is most likely to drive the value of the Internet Computer network over the long term.",

To bypass the hindrances such as limited performance and ad hoc governance that inherently exist in PoW chains, Cosmos was envisioned as a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable PoS blockchains. The ideal solution, according to Cosmos, was a tool for interacting with multiple parallel blockchains such that the unique value proposed by a chain can be expanded to any other chain.\n\nThe idea of a Proof-of-Stake blockchain with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism originates from the year 2014 when the future Tendermint Inc. co-founder Jae Kwon explored the possibilities in his research. With the participation of Ethan Buchman, the other Tendermint Inc. co-founder, this idea was further developed in 2015, and Cosmos was introduced in 2016. Tendermint Inc. and Interchain Foundation (ICF) have been responsible for the development and adoption of the technologies underlying the Cosmos network, Tendermint Core (a BFT consensus mechanism) and the Cosmos SDK (a modular framework for building new blockchains).\n\nICF ran a successful initial coin offering for ATOM in 2017 and used the collected funds to boost the development of Cosmos SDK, IBC, and Peggy. The first blockchain of the network, Cosmos Hub, launched on mainnet in 2019, and since then, many well-known projects have sprouted in the network such as Terra, THORChain, and Crypto.com.",

Since the consensus mechanism and application layer are separate informational domains in Cosmos blockchains, the changes in the state-machines (e.g. transactions on the blockchain) are communicated to the Tendermint consensus engine through the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI). Another implication of this separateness is that the blockchains on the network are not limited by strict rules when choosing a consensus mechanism. They do not require to use of Tendermint's vanilla version and can make adjustments on the consensus mechanism to render it suitable for application-specific purposes.",

Any user can submit proposals on protocol upgrades, modifications to network parameters, bounty allocations, and other governance policies and participate in discussions on the Cosmos governance forum. Since community governance plays an essential role in the development and stability of the network, Cosmos Hub obliges each validator to vote on every proposal. Those who do not vote, get penalized by the protocol and their validator status gets deactivated for a predetermined period of time. The Cosmos Hub also benefits from an additional aiding agent named Governance Working Group which aims to equip Cosmos governance with structural tools, improve governance functionality, and conduct educational efforts to further the awareness and the adoption of Cosmos governance.",

This requirement is a protective measure against proposal spamming.  The party submitting the proposal does not necessarily need to provide the deposit themselves, or in other words, any ATOM holder can contribute to this deposit to support the proposal. Contributors can reclaim their tokens once the proposal gets accepted or if it fails to reach the minimum threshold after two weeks.\n\n__Phase 2: The Voting Period__ \nThe deposit period ends once the proposal reaches the minimum deposit amount and a two-week-long voting period begins. There are four voting options (“Yes”, “No”, “No with Veto”, “Abstain”). During the voting process;\n- Only staked (bonded) tokens can participate in governance.\n- Voting power is measured in terms of stake. The amount of ATOMs staked determines the direct influence of the user on the decision-making process (coin voting).\n- Delegators inherit the vote of the validators they are delegated to unless they individually cast their vote, which will overwrite validator decisions.\n__Phase 3: Tallying Results__ \nFollowing requirements need to be satisfied for a proposal to get a passing vote:\n- __Quorum__: More than 40% of the total staked tokens need to have participated in the vote.\n- __Threshold__: More than 50% of the tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding “Abstain” votes) need to have voted in favor of the proposal (“Yes”).\n- __Veto__: The number of votes cast for \"No with Veto\" shouldn't be greater than 33.4% of the tokens that participated (after excluding “Abstain” votes).\nThe proposal gets rejected if one of these requirements is not met at the end of the voting period. And if a proposal fails to pass the vote for any reason, the deposited tokens associated with the submission are not refunded and instead transferred to the community pool.\n\n__Phase 4: Implementing the Proposal__ \nAccepted proposals regarding protocol upgrades and network parameter modifications are integrated with a new version of Cosmos. Proposals regarding fund allocation, marketing activities, or any other decision that needs to be executed off-chain require additional operational management from the community.\n\n[List of current and part proposals](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals)",

Business applications can be built on top of Thor for smart contract creation and data auditing. VeChain plans to develop Thor smart contract development with visualization tools and support for multiple languages.\n\nVeChain IDs are a key component of the VeChain blockchain. Physical good tracked with VeChain are assigned digital identities created with a SHA256 hash and tracked with NFC, RFID, and QR codes. \n\nVeChain uses a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism that relies on masternodes to validate transactions. Authoritative masternodes are selected by the VeChain Foundation and the VeChain community after Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.\n\nVeChain’s blockchain circulates two tokens. The first, VET, is the network’s primary medium of exchange for governance and payments. The second, VeThor (VTHO), is a token for a lower transaction fee model that is credited to VeChain users daily based on the amount of VET they hold. VeThor is used to executing smart contracts and transactions on the VeChain blockchain. \n\nVeChain blockchain users are categorized as users and service providers. VeChain users include manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and other enterprise clients. Service providers build specific applications on the network like smart contracts and other blockchain-based software applications. ",

After an internal investigation, the Vechain Foundation attributed the cause of the hack to the negligence of its own staff, citing an improper wallet creation allowed the attack to steal the Foundation's private key. The Foundation tagged the address, which would compromise any subsequent transactions as well, and notified \"all exchanges to monitor, blacklist, and freeze any funds coming from the thief’s address.\"\n\nLearn more from the VeChain Foundation's debrief of the hack"

Rogoff’s 2016 book The Curse of Cash looks at the past, present and future of currency from standardized coinage to crypto-currencies.

His monthly syndicated column on global economic issues is published in over 50 countries.\n\nRogoff is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Group of Thirty, and He is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Buyers have the right at any point during the first year of purchase to re-sell tokens back to the Foundation at 90% of the purchase price. Algorand initially planned to hold a series of these Dutch auctions to distribute a total of 3 billion ALGOs (30% of supply), but no further token sales have been announced.\n\nThe end of the sale coincided with the Algorand’s mainnet launch, which created 10 billion ALGOs at genesis. A total of 2.5 billion ALGO tokens (25% of the initial supply) were granted to the founders and the Algorand Foundation to support continued protocol development. The rest of the ALGO will be distributed through rewards, grants, and auctions as detailed in the supply curve section. "

The ALGOs will be distributed via various programs like hackathons, competitions, and events.\n\nThere will be a maximum of 10 billion ALGOs in circulation (minus the 20.5 million burned ALGOs from the inaugural auction early redemption program in Aug. 2019 as well as the 5 million burned Algos from the final auction redemption window in Jul. 2020). The ALGOs will be introduced into the network over time as follows:\n\nEstimated ALGOs to be injected into circulation (initially via auction, distributed over time) - 2.5 billion\nEstimated participation rewards (distributed over time) - 1.9 billion\nEarly relay node runners (distributed over time) - 3.1 billion\nAlgorand, Inc. - 2.0 billion \nAlgorand Foundation - 0.5 billion\n\nAuction refund program\nIn Aug. 2019, Algorand offered auction investors the opportunity to receive a 90% refund on their purchased tokens. Investor returns totaled $19.9 million tokens, which constituted almost 80% of the original auction supply. The Algorand Foundation later burned these ALGOs as well as the 609,343.1208 AGLOs that address received as participation rewards (aka inflation), permanently removing them from circulation.\n\nIn Jun. 2020, the 2019 Algo auction participants who did not avail of the early redemption window in Aug. 2019 qualified to opt for a second and final Auction redemption window. Investor returns totaled five million ALGO. As occurred during the optional early redemption in August 2019, all Algos returned via this refund mechanism were burned (permanently taken out of circulation).\n\nRelay node accelerated vesting\nOn Sep. 30th, 2019, relay nodes voted in favor of delaying their ALGO payouts, which would allow Algorand and relay node operators to discuss potential modifications to the rewards schedule. Algorand investors USV and Pillar offered support for a new, elongated vesting schedule since the ALGO supply growth at the time was \"too large relative to the state of adoption.\" Relay nodes opted to delay their ALGO rewards twice more until the network passed EIP-11252019AF, which extended the vesting plan from two years to five years, meaning payouts would complete by the end of 2024. But this new schedule rewarded relay nodes by increasing their share of the ALGO supply by 25% and offered an accelerated vesting schedule should the price of ALGO reach specific targets.\n\nUnvested tokens dedicated to relay nodes will now vest according to the following guaranteed base vesting schedule:\nYear 1 (2020) 3% (for a total of 17%, as relay nodes had already received 14% of their total share at this point)\nYear 2 (2021), 8% (for a total of 25%)\nYear 3 (2022), 25% (for a total of 50%)\nYear 4 (2023), 35% (for a total of 85%)\nYear 5 (2024), 40% (for a total of 125%)\n\nAlthough this schedule can accelerate depending on the 30-day moving average of AGLO price, Algorand used the base vesting schedule to determine the supply curve.",

It becomes impossible for the minority to cheat and irrational for the majority to cheat the system as it would devalue their holdings. There is also no locking of tokens so a user has their tokens available at all times. Blocks are created in two phases where a single token is selected randomly and its owner proposes the next block. Subsequently, 1000 random tokens are selected with their owners then approving the block proposed by the first user. \n\nThese phases are ensured by the core protocol called Binary Byzantine Agreement, or Byzantine Agreement ★ (‘Star’), encompassing the following advancements:\nCryptographic sortition (self-selection) To prevent an adversary from targeting committee members, BA★ uses verifiable random functions (VRFs) to randomly select committee members in a private and non-interactive way. \nParticipant replaceability. BA★ mitigates adversary targeting a committee member by requiring committee members to speak just once, thus becoming irrelevant to BA★. \n\nExperimental results running on 1,000 Amazon EC2 VMs demonstrate that Algorand can confirm a 1 MByte block of transactions in ~22 seconds with 50,000 users, latency remains nearly constant when scaling to half a million users, it achieves 125X the transaction throughput of Bitcoin, and that Algorand achieves acceptable latency even in the presence of actively malicious users. \n\nA test network for the protocol was launched in July 2018, and the first open-source code was released on Github in October 2018. As such, Algorand encourages anyone to audit its version of the VRF, forked and extended from the widely popular libsodium cryptographic library.  ",

For instance, if a proposal is accepted, community members collectively determine which block the update to implement. Any user can participate in Algorand’s governance system.\n\nAt the moment, the Algorand team constructs and releases protocol upgrades. But as described in the consensus-based approach above, node operators ultimately determine whether to accept or reject the code changes. Once Algorand releases a protocol upgrade, at least 90% of network nodes must approve the change (done simply by upgrading their node) before the code changes are considered active (i.e., are accessible to users and developers). If approved, the remaining network nodes have a grace period of 140,000 blocks (about seven days) to complete the upgrade before being \"kicked-off\" (unable to sync with) the network. This \"upgrade-required window\" recently increased from 10,000 blocks to 140,000 blocks with the activation of Algorand v2.0.2",

            "background_details": "KuCoin is a cryptoasset exchange that describes itself as a hybrid exchange integrating features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The long-term goal of the team is to transition to a fully decentralized exchange model. \n\nCurrently, the exchange operates through more of a centralized model, attempting to duplicate best practices in traditional asset exchanges including dedicated risk and compliance teams. These teams are responsible for internal controls and cross-departmental reviews aimed at reducing fraudulent activity on the platform.\n\nKuCoin Shares (KCS) is a token used to reward users and attract new customers to the exchange. Users holding a specified amount of KCS in their account are eligible for discounts on trading fees. Furthermore, holders of KCS receive a daily dividend, called a KuCoin bonus, equal to 50% of trading fees on the exchange. Those that have referred new users to the platform are eligible to receive 40% of fees while the exchange retains the remaining 10%. Dividends are paid in whichever token was the most traded during the day.\n\nTo encourage referrals, each user receives a registration link they can share. Referral bonuses are paid for both direct and indirect activity. Users receive bonuses for both the activity of their direct referrals as well as the activity from any new users their referrals add to the platform. Users holding enough KCS in their exchange account receive a discount on trading fees. KCS held off-exchange is not eligible for this rebate program. Additional benefits such as a personal investment consultation and expedited customer service are offered to users on a tiered basis as they increase their KCS holdings.\n\nWhile trading rebates and referrals are the current use case for KCS KuCoin plans to use the token for transaction fees once they launch a fully decentralized platform. Current trading fees on the exchange are 0.1% at the time of this report.",

To minimize the chances for disruptions the operations team is split between two sites in Hong Kong and Singapore. Three data centers are maintained with overlapping functionality so operations for the entire business can be run using any of the centers.\n\nThe trading system is designed to handle high trading volumes, up to one million orders per second, through desktop and mobile interfaces.\n\nKuCoin uses multiple wallets with varying levels of security based on the time frame for transactions. Micro-transactions are supported through a multi-firewall private network built on Amazon Web Services. KuCoin employees are provided with a unique cipher code to initiate withdrawals from the wallet. Longer term holdings are stored in bank custody with multiple signatures via independent private keys required to access them.\n\nWithdrawal requests are first inspected using an internal artificial intelligence algorithm designed to process transactions instantly while still maintaining risk and security measures. KuCoin also offers multifactor authentication for transactions. \n\nKuCoin hopes to release a feature whereby exchange participants can self-register new cryptocurrency pairs and start trading automatically to help reach the goal of having 1,000 tokens listed and a daily exchange volume exceeding 100,000 BTC by December 2018. \n\nTokens that fail to meet ongoing listing standards are not immediately delisted on the exchange but are instead put under special treatment rules. Projects may fall under this classification if they are likely to cease activities during the next three months, fail to have enough volume to make markets, appear insolvent, fail an audit, fail to report details in a timely fashion, engage in malicious market activities, dissolve the founding team, or any other reason at the discretion of KuCoin. \n\nProjects in special treatment are designated as such on the platform, so exchange participants are aware the associated token is a candidate for delisting. \n\nAt the end of the observation, period tokens are delisted if they continue not to meet the volume required for listing or the project does not take the necessary actions to remedy the reason special treatment was applied. Alternatively, if a project passes the review, it is restored to the platform in good standing, and the special treatment designation is removed.",

            "background_details": "The RNDR network idea was initially conceived in 2009 by Jules Urbach, the CEO of its parent company, the Los Angeles Tech company OTOY inc., a company specialized in GPU-based software solutions. The idea behind the RNDR network was leveraging blockchain technology to improve the usage of GPUs across the world for something other than Proof-of-Work for other blockchains. In a nutshell, RNDR intends to connect media creators in need of computing power to perform render jobs to people who have their hardware idle and want to monetize that. The RNDR tokens are used to pay the usage fees to these users. It also allows new users who are unfamiliar with Cryptocurrency an easy way to get started on the network while they get comfortable by using RNDR credits. Unlike RNDR Tokens, RNDR Credits can be purchased using PayPal and Stripe, directly through the RNDR Portal. When a user purchases RNDR Credits, those Credits are backed by RNDR Tokens that have been purchased off of an exchange by the RNDR Team. This means that when a creator pays for a job using RNDR Credits, node operators are paid out in RNDR Tokens for their work.  \n\nThe Initial Coin offer was conducted from Oct. 6, 2017 to Oct. 12, 2017. During the process a total of 4650922 RNDR were sold at $0.25 USD per token. In March 2018 the team announced that the total minted tokens in the ecosystem would be 536,870,912 RNDR. The process of contract migration started with a 1:1 migration ratio between old and new contracts in March 2018. The Genesis Mainnet release occured on Jun. 24, 2019 when the project was migrated from the Ropsten Testnet to the Ethereum Mainnet and from this point beyond. Then, in March 2020 the team announced a purchased plan of 4.5 million RNDR tokens on the Probit exchange, taking advantage of the market situations on that time.\n\nThe final product was launched in April 2020 and its accessible at  https://rndr.otoy.com/",

These credits are all backed by real tokens, meaning every time a user acquires credits the same amount of tokens are acquired by the RNDR team from an exchange. This helps ease the entrance of new players in the system, while endure the node operators will be paid always in the same native token.  \n\nFor users not using RNDR credits, a wallet needs to be created. It needs to be an ERC-20 compatible wallet, being MetaMask the preferred wallet of the RNDR team. It should not be a a wallet from an exchange. This wallet is then linked to the user profile and made available for make and receive payments.  \n\nThe RNDR network has two smart contracts. In February 2019 it was announced updates in the token to include additional escrow smart-contract functionality, and the token migration process started. The conversion of the Old to the new tokens was defined as 1:1, and has no deadline."

            "technology_details": "The objective of RNDR is connect graphic creators in need of GPU power to perform render jobs to users with idle resources (Node Operators). The user in need of a render job pays for the service in RNDR, while the network takes care of the transaction and allocates the job among the nodes. A small percentage of the payment is charged as a service fee (0.5 to 5% of the total needed to process the job, depending on supply and demand), and helps to maintain the peer-to-peer network. To participate, users create accounts linked to the Ethereum Blockchain and unique wallets, and then start to interact with the RNDR token and network.  \n\nThe network confirms work using automated and user generated verifications. Creators are encouraged to approve jobs that are correctly processed through the system. Final renders are not released until all watermarked previews are confirmed, which incentivizes the creators to confirm the processed frames. If something goes wrong, a creator has the ability to reject the frame, and the frames will automatically be assigned to another node on the network for re-rendering.‌ It also uses Reputation Scores for both creators and node operators as the main mechanism for resource allocation in the network, in a way that creators with a higher reputation score will have access to more nodes, as well as node operators with better reputation scores will get jobs assigned faster.  \n\nWhen a job is requested, the network will enter a transaction with 2 parties - the node operator, who is providing the computing power and the user who requested the render job to be run. The cost of the transactions is calculated in RNDR by the network and finally the smart contract moves the amount from one account to the other. The key players in this process are listed below:\nThe RNDR Network: Coordinates and facilitates the supply and demand for render jobs using smart contracts. It automatically allocates the render jobs across nodes and perform the payments for the services;  \nNode Operators: Provide computing power to perform the render jobs and are paid by the network in RNDR tokens. Node operators can join the network using a desktop client, and then receive unique ID that will be linked to the wallet. Joining the web, the network can determine benchmark information that will be used to better allocate the resources.\nCreators: The final users of the network. People in need of computing power to perform render jobs, which is achieved by connecting to a web interface, linking a wallet and selecting the job preferences. As soon as the work is processed, the user confirms that the output was generated and pays the fees.\nDual Operators: Users who play the role of node operator and creators. Usually sell to the network idle GPU power when not using their hardware to accumulate RNDR that can be used when in need of extra computing power to run a job.",

            "background_details": "Filecoin is looking to provide an alternative to traditional online storage providers and protocols. Its technology acts as an incentive layer for the peer-to-peer file transfer system IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which uses hash-addressed content structures to store data instead of centralized servers and IP addresses. This is intended to reduce redundancy, increase permanence, and improve efficiency. \n\nFilecoin incentivizes IPFS by rewarding storage providers and retrievers for contributing resources to the system. The network also comes with built-in Ethereum integration allowing developers to access data on Ethereum’s blockchain and interact with its smart contracts.\n\nFilecoin is being developed by Protocol Labs, a development firm founded in 2014 by Juan Benet. Benet and crew constructed Filecoin and IPFS in tandem, raising a few Seed equity rounds to fund the process. In 2017, the team hosted a token sale to secure funds for Filecoin's development, which raised around $205 million in one of the largest token offerings at the time.\n\nProtocol Labs seeks to build a fundamental layer for data infrastructure that can be used by both blockchain and traditional providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. The project plans to achieve this goal by creating a marketplace in which any user who has storage capacity can connect to the network, creating a supply of unused storage both in consumer hardware as well as data centers of existing businesses. The Filecoin team believes this will reduce the price of storage in a way similar to how sharing economy companies like Airbnb reduced the price of short-term rentals in marketplaces traditionally dominated by large players with large capital requirements.",

Vesting for advisors ranged from one to three years. The remaining $153 million was raised from investors with FIL tokens priced based on a linearly increasing function. The starting price for the sale was $1.00 per FIL and increased up to $5.00 per FIL using the formula (price = $ amount raised / 40 million), with a hard cap of 200 million FIL sold.

Clients (network users) can source miners of data storage and data retrieval, different operations that existing within separate decentralized markets. PoSt provides a level of verifiability so that data can be stored and retrieved in a distributed, multi-market system.\n\nMining\nStorage miners can earn FIL by storing data for clients and \"computing cryptographic proofs to verify storage across time.\" Unlike Proof-of-Work mining, the probability of earning a block reward (and transaction fees) is \"proportional to the amount of storage the miner contributes to the network.\"\n\nOn the other hand, retrieval miners can receive FIL by winning bids for a client request. The market value of the file in question determines the miner's payout. Available bandwidth and initial response time for details (which could be influenced by network latency or proximity to a client) impact a miner's ability to close deals and retrieve data on the network. Therefore, the \"maximum bandwidth of a retrieval miner will set the total quantity of deals\" they can win.\n\nWith the network still in development, the mining equipment specifications (specifically for CPU and RAM) remain unknown. But the team insists the mining hardware will contain configurations with many standard hard drives and that any “specialized Filecoin mining hardware” will not exceed anything more than a highly optimized hard drive (in a sense, not optimal for ASICs). Filecoin also notes note that early storage and retrieval miners will be required to run full nodes.\n",

            "technology_details": "Protocol Labs introduced many new technologies in its Filecoin whitepaper that could add value to multiple blockchain projects. Filecoin is secured by proof-of-work in the same way that bitcoin is, but this work is specifically related to storage of data Instead of finding a random nonce to make the block hash fit in a target range, the networks proof-of-work is restricted to proving that a miner has stored data for a specific duration and replication. This is achieved with two new types of proof-of-work: proof-of-replication (PoRep) and proof-of-spacetime (PoSt). \n\nProof-of-replication allows a server to convince a user that some data has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated physical storage while proof-of-spacetime allows an efficient prover to convince a verifier that they are storing some data for a specified duration of time. \n\nThese proofs allow Filecoin to solve issues with large-scale storage networks made of independent parties, by making it theoretically impossible to falsify data storage records to increase miner rewards. Competitors like Siacoin ($SC) and Storj ($STORJ) lack this functionality, though they have not yet created enough storage demand for this to be a significant issue. \n\nMiner proofs are used to create a network based on three primary methods, put, get, and manage. The put and get methods are responsible for putting data in storage and accessing it on client request respectively. The manage method is responsible for managing the marketplace by matching buy and sell orders as well as managing buyer and seller reputation on the platform. \n\nThese methods are executed across two marketplaces, storage and retrieval, which are managed by the different miners. Protocol Labs believes that miners will often participate in both markets. Storage miners are responsible for receiving put requests and storing client data while also pledging collateral proportional to the data. They will be penalized by losing this collateral in the event of invalid or missing proofs. Storage providers run the manage method in conjunction with clients and auditors. Retrieval miners are responsible for managing get requests and giving clients their data. While retrieval miners do not need to pledge collateral, they are still compensated in the native Filecoin for performing work for the network. ",

The Fetch.AI mainnet went live in Jan 2020. The Cambridge-based artificial intelligence lab is building AI for blockchains.\n\nFetch.AI is an open-source decentralized machine learning platform based on a distributed ledger that provides users access to AI in the format of secure datasets.\n\nOn the Fetch.ai network, a series of software agents represent and act on behalf of their owners. These autonomous agents work to provide an optimized service across a variety of ecosystems, benefitting both suppliers and consumers. The Fetch.Ai framework aims to support billions of IoT devices to facilitate seamless communication in an automated and secure manner. Fetch.AI autonomous agents have the ability to conduct searches, negotiate and trade knowledge, and share both predictions and value.\n\nThe early use cases Fetch.ai is targeting include:\nOptimizing trading for financial services users\nReconfiguring public transport networks\nSupporting smart cities’ ability to adapt to citizen behavior\nDisintermediate the gig economy to remove middlemen\nConnecting energy networks to smart grids\nBy decentralizing access to data, Fetch.ai hopes to distribute the power of existing data monopolies. Fetch.ai’s framework is optimized via autonomous agents that categorize data semantically, geographically, or by economic features. Fetch.ai’s permissionless network enables anyone to share or exchange information via autonomous agents.",

Fetch.AI’s token allows agents access to the digital world in the form of services, data, infrastructure, or access to data processing such as AI and ML algorithms.\n\nFetch.AI tokens are designed with various purposes including:\n\nOperational Costs\nOperation costs in Fetch.AI are decoupled from the Fetch.AI token in a similar way to that of “gas” on the Ethereum network, but with additional functionality designed to increase the stability of such “gas costs” and look at addressing issues associated with high and low-velocity economies. Fetch.AI’s operational fuel allows access to processor time for contract execution and services for agents.\n\nAbility to connect agents and nodes to the network. \nThis is an access deposit token that acts as a form of stake to demonstrate desire to behave appropriately. It modulates the ability for bad actors to flood the network with undesirable nodes or agents due to the escalating cost of doing so. \n\nAccess and exchange value\nThe Fetch.AI token is required for agents to perform exchanges of value (data, service, etc). Since FET is divisible, low-cost and microtransactions are possible within the network. FET is needed to access, view, and interact with the network and digital world. Agents, which can represent digital entities, require FET in order to access aspects of the network.\n\nMachine learning and Synergetic Computing services\nThe Fetch.AI token enables the development of and access to a broad range of machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks that are available on the ledger. These may be primary services, developed by Fetch.AI, such as trust and prediction models, or they may be large-scale independently developed services for network users. Fetch.AI refers to these collectively as Synergetic Computing."

These unique features can be further extended to many other applications such as IoT and decentralized machine learning to enhance the capabilities of the Fetch.ai network.\n\nFetch.ai believes that blockchains require a time-to-finality rate that provides a comparable experience to current centralized payment systems. The finality problem is a technical limitation of blockchains that has acted as a barrier to wider adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nFetch.ai’s dynamic consensus is designed to help blockchains achieve finality sooner, making networks more efficient. Fetch.ai plans to assist non-blockchain applications with time-stamping activities in real-time.\n\nThe consensus mechanism uses unique tools that Fetch.ai has developed for generating decentralized and incorruptible sources of randomness. These cryptographic techniques can be used as oracles in applications that involve coordinating multiple stakeholders in areas such as finance, gaming, and logistics. Unbiased randomness can, for example, be used to choose which trades should be matched in decentralized exchanges, deal cards in a decentralized game of poker, or decide which company in a transport consortium should fulfill a delivery. Fetch.ai claims that this consensus mechanism will support both existing industrial applications and blockchain-enabled applications.\n\nIncorruptible randomness is also key to the Fetch.ai Minimal Agency (min-agency) consensus, which is designed so that all users have fair access to the protocol. This is achieved by ensuring that individual validators have very little influence over which transactions reach the global state and their eventual ordering.\n\nMinimal Agency consensus utilizes a hybrid system that combines some features of DAGs and blockchain-based ledgers.\n\nThe min-agency consensus uses a DAG to continuously synchronize transactions and ensures that all participants in the network can commit transactions to the global state at any time. In general, DAGs come with various tradeoffs including greater storage costs from holding redundant information and non-ordered transactions which poses some challenges for implementing smart contracts. Various DAG-based protocols implement solutions to help alleviate these tradeoffs.\n\nThe min-agency consensus collapses the DAG at regular intervals which occurs when a validator adds a signature (notarizes) vertices that have been validated by at least half of all validators. Subsequently, all of the transactions that have been notarized are converted into a block that is added to the blockchain to finalize the transactions.\n\nIn min-agency consensus, the ordering and choice over which transactions are added to the block is made by a deterministic algorithm that also uses cryptographic randomness. Fetch.ai asserts that min-agency consensus will improve fairness and censorship resistance thereby preventing abuses such as validator front-running users in decentralized exchanges.",

The network support autonomous agents which can perform tasks such as delivering data or providing services and are rewarded with a digital currency for their efforts — the FET Token.\nFetch.ai has three key technological primitives that underpin the Fetch.AI network.\n\nAutonomous Economic Agents (AEAs)\nAn AEA is an intelligent program operating on an owner's behalf, with limited or no interference of the ownership entity, and whose goal is to generate economic value for its owner.\nAutonomic agents can be thought of as digital entities that are able to make their own decisions. The Fetch.AI network dynamically reorganizes itself to provide an environment for agents to operate in.\nEssentially, this means rearranging space to place agents that can provide value \"close\" to agents that are searching for that value. Each agent therefore \"sees\" a different world from its perspective: a world that\nis reorganized for its perceived and declared needs.\nAEAs can be used to represent real-world objects, people, or assets in a digital space and enable them to communicate and transact quickly and efficiently. AEAs act independently of constant user input and autonomously execute actions to achieve their goal.\n\nOpen Economic Framework (OEF)\nThe OEF is the high-level node functionality: the layer on top of the raw protocol and ledger that delivers this environment and all the other operations agents need to operate. This connectivity layer enables a decentralized search for autonomous agents who can then find each other and exchange with one another. Agents conduct these transactions using a Fetch.AI’s native asset, FET. Through these interactions, the agents negotiate and transact for their owners. This layer also provides interoperability between various systems connecting different devices, businesses, and services.\n\nA Smart Ledger\nThe final aspect of Fetch.AI’s network is its AI-powered blockchain ledger which logs all of the agents’ transactions. As the agents and ledger gain more data it will provide public market intelligence, previously locked up in centralized silos.",

Splitting the traditional monolithic layer 1 architecture into a 2 layer system (data availability layer + execution layer) is the core of what set Celestia apart from other networks.
